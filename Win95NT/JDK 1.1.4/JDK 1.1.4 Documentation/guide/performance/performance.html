<h1>JDK 1.1 Performance Enhancements</h1>

For JDK performance measurements, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/performance/index.html">Performance Measurements</a> on the JavaSoft website.
<ul>
   <li><strong>Interpreter Loop in Assembly Code on Win32 and Solaris/SPARC </strong>
<br>Since portions of the Java VM have been rewritten in assembly
language, the resulting VM now runs up to five times faster on certain
operations.<br><br>
   <li><strong>Non-Continuous Heap Support for Mac</strong><br>
        Improved memory usage on Macintosh computers enables Java to run
more smoothly with other applications.<br><br>

   <li><strong>Monitor Speedups</strong><br>
        Synchronized methods enable operations to run more quickly and
efficiently.<br><br>

<li><strong>Garbage Collection of Classes</strong><br>
        This enhancement automatically discards unused classes.  Improved
overall VM memory usage enables Java to operate more efficiently, and with
less memory.<br><br>

<li><strong>AWT Peer Class Re-Write for Win32</strong><br>
        To achieve higher performance, AWT peer native classes have been
completely rewritten to be hosted running on top of Win32.<br><br>

<li><strong>JAR (Java Archive) bundling of resources for a single HTTP transaction</strong><br>
        JAR is a new JDK 1.1 platform-independent file format that
aggregates many files into one.  Java applets and their requisite
components--such as class files, images and sounds--can be bundled into a
compressed JAR file and downloaded to a browser in a single HTTP
transaction to reduce download time.  In addition, applet authors can
digitally sign individual entries in a JAR file to authenticate their
origin.<br><br>
