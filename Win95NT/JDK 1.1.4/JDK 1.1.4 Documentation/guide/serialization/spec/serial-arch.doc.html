Overview
</a></h1>The capability to store and retrieve Java objects is essential to building all but 
the most transient applications. The key to storing and retrieving objects is 
representing the state of objects in a serialized form sufficient to reconstruct the 
object(s). Objects to be saved in the stream may support either the Serializable 
or the Externalizable Interface. For Java objects, the serialized form must be 
able to identify and verify the Java class from which the object's contents were 
saved and to restore the contents to a new instance. For Serializable objects, the 
stream includes sufficient information to restore the fields in the stream to a 
compatible version of the class. For Externalizable objects, the class is solely 
responsible for the external format of its contents.
<p>Objects to be stored and retrieved frequently refer to other objects. Those other 
objects must be stored and retrieved at the same time to maintain the 
relationships between the objects. When an object is stored, all of the objects 
that are reachable from that object are stored as well.
<p>The goals for serializing Java objects are to:
<p><ul><li>Have a simple yet extensible mechanism.
<li>Maintain the Java object type and safety properties in the serialized form.
<li>Be extensible to support marshaling and unmarshaling as needed for remote 
objects.
<li>Be extensible to support persistence of Java objects.
<li>Require per class implementation only for customization.
<li>Allow the object to define its external format.
</ul><h1><a name="4176">
Writing to an Object Stream
</a></h1>Writing objects and primitives to a stream is a straight-forward process. For 
example:
<p><dl><pre>// Serialize today's date to a file.
	FileOutputStream f = new FileOutputStream("tmp");
	ObjectOutput &#32;s &#32;= &#32;new &#32;ObjectOutputStream(f);
	s.writeObject("Today");
	s.writeObject(new Date());
	s.flush();
</pre></dl>First an <code>OutputStream</code>, in this case a <code>FileOutputStream</code>, is needed to receive 
the bytes. Then an <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> is created that writes to the 
<code>OutputStream</code>. Next, the string "Today" and a Date object are written to the 
stream. More generally, objects are written with the <code>writeObject</code> method and 
primitives are written to the stream with the methods of <code>DataOutput</code>.
<p>The <code><a href="output.doc.html#1038">writeObject</a></code> method 
serializes the specified object and traverses its references to other objects in the 
object graph recursively to create a complete serialized representation of the 
graph. Within a stream, the first reference to any object results in the object 
being serialized or externalized and the assignment of a handle for that object. 
Subsequent references to that object are encoded as the handle. Using object 
handles preserves sharing and circular references that occur naturally in object 
graphs. Subsequent references to an object use only the handle allowing a very 
compact representation.
<p>Special handling is required for objects of type <code>Class</code>, <code>ObjectStreamClass</code>, 
strings, and arrays. Other objects must implement either Serializable or 
Externalizable interfaces to be saved in or restored from a stream. 
<p>Primitive data types are written to the stream with the methods in the 
<code>DataOutput</code> interface, such as <code>writeInt</code>, <code>writeFloat</code>, or <code>writeUTF</code>. 
Individual bytes and arrays of bytes are written with the methods of 
<code>OutputStream</code>. All primitive data is written to the stream in block-data 
records prefixed by a marker and the length. Putting the data in records allows 
it to be skipped if necessary.
<p><code>ObjectOutputStream</code> can be extended to customize the information about 
classes in the stream or to replace objects to be serialized. Refer to the 
<code>annotateClass</code> and <code>replaceObject</code> method descriptions for details.
<p><h1><a name="4188">
Reading from an Object Stream
</a></h1>Reading an object from a stream, like writing, is straight-forward:
<p><dl><pre>// Deserialize a string and date from a file.
	FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("tmp");
	ObjectInputStream s = new ObjectInputStream(in);
	String today = (String)s.readObject();
	Date date = (Date)s.readObject();
</pre></dl>First an <code>InputStream</code>, in this case a <code>FileInputStream</code>, is needed as the 
source stream. Then an <code>ObjectInputStream</code> is created that reads from the 
<code>InputStream</code>. Next, the string "Today" and a Date object are read from the 
stream. Generally, objects are read with the <code>readObject</code> method and 
primitives are read from the stream with the methods of <code>DataInput</code>.
<p>The <code><a href="input.doc.html#2971">readObject</a></code> method deserializes the next object in the stream and 
traverses its references to other objects recursively to create the complete graph 
of objects serialized.
<p>Primitive data types are read from the stream with the methods in the 
<code>DataOutput</code> interface, such as <code>readInt</code>, <code>readFloat</code>, or <code>readUTF</code>. Individual 
bytes and arrays of bytes are read with the methods of <code>InputStream</code>. All 
primitive data is read from block-data records.
<p>ObjectInputStream can be extended to utilize customized information in the 
stream about classes or to replace objects that have been deserialized. Refer to 
the <code>resolveClass</code> and <code>resolveObject</code> method descriptions for details.
<p><h1><a name="962">
Object Streams as Containers
</a></h1>Object Serialization produces and consumes a stream of bytes that contain one 
or more primitives and objects. The objects written to the stream, in turn, refer 
to other objects which are also represented in the stream. Object Serialization 
produces just one stream format that encodes and stores the contained objects. 
Object Serialization has been designed to provide a rich set of features for Java 
classes. Other container formats such as OLE or OpenDoc have different 
stream or file system representations. 
<p>Each object acting as a container implements an interface that allows primitives 
and objects to be stored in or retrieved from it. These are the <code>ObjectOutput</code> 
and <code>ObjectInput</code> interfaces which:
<p><ul><li>Provide a stream to write to and read from
<li>Handle requests to write primitive types and objects to the stream,
</ul>Each object which is to be stored in a stream must explicitly allow itself to be 
stored and must implement the protocols needed to save and restore its state. 
Object Serialization defines two such protocols. The protocols allow the 
container to ask the object to write and read its state. To be stored in an Object 
Stream, each object must implement either the Serializable or the 
Externalizable interface.
<p>For a Serializable class, Object Serialization can automatically save and restore 
fields of each class of an object and automatically handle classes that evolve by 
adding fields or supertypes. A Serializable class can declare which of its fields 
are transient (not saved or restored), and write and read optional values and 
objects.
<p>For an Externalizable class, Object Serialization delegates to the class complete 
control over its external format and how the state of the supertype is saved and 
restored.
<p><h1><a name="4542">
The ObjectOutput Interface
</a></h1>The <code>ObjectOutput</code> interface provides an abstract, stream-based interface to 
object storage. It extends DataOutput so those methods may be used for 
writing primitive data types. Objects implementing this interface can be used 
to store primitives and objects.
<p><dl><pre>package java.io;

public interface ObjectOutput extends DataOutput
{
	public void writeObject(Object obj) throws IOException;

	public void write(int b) throws IOException;

	public void write(byte b[]) throws IOException;

	public void write(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException;

	public void flush() throws IOException;

	public void close() throws IOException;
}
</pre></dl>The <code>writeObject</code> method is used to write an object. The exceptions thrown 
reflect errors while accessing the object or its fields, or exceptions that occur in 
writing to storage. If any exception is thrown, the underlying storage may be 
corrupted, and you should refer to the object implementing this interface for 
details.
<p><h1><a name="4548">
The ObjectInput Interface
</a></h1>The <code>ObjectInput</code> interface provides an abstract stream based interface to 
object retrieval. It extends <code>DataInput</code> so those methods for reading primitive 
data types are accessible in this interface.
<p><dl><pre>package java.io;

public interface ObjectInput extends DataInput
{
	public Object readObject()
		throws ClassNotFoundException, IOException;

    public int read() throws IOException;

	public int read(byte b[]) throws IOException;

    public int read(byte b[], int off, int len) throws IOException;

    public long skip(long n) throws IOException;

	public int available() throws IOException;

    public void close() throws IOException;
}
</pre></dl>The <code>readObject</code> method is used to read and return an object. The exceptions 
thrown reflect errors while accessing the objects or its fields or exceptions that 
occur in reading from the storage. If any exception is thrown, the underlying 
storage may be corrupted, refer to the object implementing this interface for 
details.
<p><h1><a name="4539">
The Serializable Interface
</a></h1>Object Serialization produces a stream with information about the Java classes 
for the objects that are being saved. For Serializable objects, sufficient 
information is kept to restore those objects even if a different (but compatible) 
version of the class's implementation is present. The interface Serializable is 
defined to identify classes that implement the Serializable protocol:
<p><dl><pre>package java.io;

public interface Serializable {};
</pre></dl>A <code>Serializable</code> object:
<p><ul><li>Must implement the <code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface.
<li>Must mark its fields that are not to be persistent with the transient keyword.
<li>Can implement a <code>writeObject</code> method to control what information is 
saved, or to append additional information to the stream.
<li>Can implement a <code>readObject</code> method so it can read the information 
written by the corresponding <code>writeObject</code> method, or to update the state 
of the object after it has been restored.
</ul><code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>ObjectInputStream</code> are designed and 
implemented to allow the Serializable classes they operate on to evolve. Evolve 
in this context means to allow changes to the classes that are compatible with 
the earlier versions of the classes. Details of the mechanism to allow 
compatible changes can be found in <a href="version.doc.html#6519">Compatible Java Type 
Evolution</a>.
<p><h1><a name="4333">
The Externalizable Interface
</a></h1>For Externalizable objects only the identity of class of the object is saved by the 
container and it is the responsibility of the class to save and restore the 
contents. The interface Externalizable is defined as:
<p><dl><pre>package java.io;

public interface Externalizable extends Serializable
{
	public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out)
		throws IOException;

	public void readExternal(ObjectInput in)
		throws IOException, java.lang.ClassNotFoundException;
}
</pre></dl>An <code>Externalizable</code> Object:
<p><ul><li>Must implement the <code>java.io.Externalizable</code> interface.
<li>Must implement a <code>writeExternal</code> method to save the state of the object. It 
must explicitly coordinate with its supertype to save its state.
<li>Must implement a <code>readExternal</code> method to read the data written by the 
<code>writeExternal</code> method from the stream and restore the state of the object. 
It must explicitly coordinate with the supertype to save its state.
<li>If writing an externally defined format, the <code>writeExternal</code> and 
<code>readExternal</code> methods are solely responsible for that format.
</ul><em>The <code>writeExternal</code> and <code>readExternal</code> methods are public and raise 
the risk that a client may be able to write or read information in the object 
other than by using its methods and fields. These methods must be used only 
when the information held by the object is not sensitive or when exposing it 
would not present a security risk.
</em><p><h1><a name="4160">
Protecting Sensitive Information
</a></h1>When developing a class that provides controlled access to resources, care 
must be taken to protect sensitive information and functions. During 
deserialization, the private state of the object is restored. For example, a file 
descriptor contains a handle that provides access to an operating system 
resource. Being able to forge a file descriptor would allow some forms of illegal 
access, since restoring state is done from a stream. Therefore, the serializing 
runtime must take the conservative approach and not trust the stream to 
contain only valid representations of objects. To avoid compromising a class, 
the sensitive state of an object must not be restored from the stream, or it must 
be reverified by the class. Several techniques are available to protect sensitive 
data in classes.
<p>The easiest technique is to mark fields that contain sensitive data as <strong>private 
transient</strong>. Transient and static fields are not serialized or deserialized. 
Marking the field will prevent the state from appearing in the stream and from 
being restored during deserialization. Since writing and reading (of private 
fields) cannot be superseded outside of the class, the class's transient fields are 
safe.
<p>Particularly sensitive classes should not be serialized at all. To accomplish this, 
the object should not implement either the Serializable or Externalizable 
interfaces.
<p>Some classes may find it beneficial to allow writing and reading but 
specifically handle and revalidate the state as it is deserialized. The class 
should implement <code>writeObject</code> and <code>readObject</code> methods to save and restore 
only the appropriate state. If access should be denied, throwing a 
<code>NotSerializableException</code> will prevent further access.
