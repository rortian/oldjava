The ObjectInputStream Class
</a></h1>Class <code>ObjectInputStream</code> implements object deserialization. It maintains the 
state of the stream including the set of objects already deserialized. Its methods 
allow primitive types and objects to be read from a stream written by 
ObjectOutputStream. It manages restoration of the object and the objects that
it refers to from the stream.

</pre></dl>The <code>ObjectInputStream</code> constructor requires an InputStream. The constructor 
calls <code>readStreamHeader</code> to read and verifies the header and version
written by the corresponding <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>.<code>writeStreamHeader</code> method.
<p>The <code>readObject</code> method is used to deserialize an object from
the stream. It reads from the stream to reconstruct an object.
<p><ol>
<li>If a block data record occurs in the stream, throw a BlockDataException 
with the number of available bytes.
<li>If the object in the stream is null, return null.
<li>If the object in the stream is a handle to a previous object, return the object.
<li>If the object in the stream is a String, read its UTF encoding, add it
and its handle to the set of known objects, and return the String.
<li>If the object in the stream is a Class, read its ObjectStreamClass descriptor, add it and its handle to the set of known objects, and return the
corresponding Class object.
<li>If the object in the stream is an ObjectStreamClass, read its name, 
serialVersionUID, and fields. Add it and its handle to the set of known 
objects. Call the resolveClass method on the stream to get the local class for 
this descriptor, and throw an exception if the class cannot be found. Return 
the ObjectStreamClass object.
<li>If the object in the stream is an array, read its ObjectStreamClass and the 
length of the array. Allocate the array, and add it and its handle in the set
of known objects. Read each element using the appropriate method for its 
type, assign it to the array, and return the array.
<li>For all other objects, the ObjectStreamClass of the object is read from the 
stream. The local class for that ObjectStreamClass is retrieved. The class 
must be serializable or externalizable.
<li>An instance of the class is allocated. The instance and its handle are
added to the set of known objects. The contents restored appropriately:
<ul>
<li>For Serializable objects, the no-arg constructor for the nonserializable 
supertype is run and then each class's fields are restored by calling class-
specific <code>readObject</code> methods, or, if these are not defined, by calling the 
<code>defaultReadObject</code> method. In the normal case, the version of the class 
that wrote the stream will be the same as the class reading the stream. In 
this case, all of the supertypes of the object in the stream will match the 
supertypes in the currently-loaded class. If the version of the class that 
wrote the stream had different supertypes than the loaded class, the 
ObjectInputStream must be more careful about restoring or initializing the 
state of the differing classes. It must step through the classes, matching the 
available data in the stream with the classes of the object being restored. 
Data for classes that occur in the stream, but do not occur in the object, is 
discarded. For classes that occur in the object, but not in the stream, the 
class fields are set to default values by default serialization.
<li>For Externalizable objects, the no-arg constructor for the class is run and 
then the <code>readExternal</code> method is called to restore the contents
of the object.
</ul>
<li>If previously enabled by <code>enableResolveObject,</code> the <code>resolveObject</code> 
method is called just before the object is returned. This allows subclasses to 
replace it if desired. The value of the call to <code>resolveObject</code> is returned 
from <code>readObject</code>.
</ol>
All of the methods for reading primitives types only consume bytes from the 
block data records in the stream. If a read for primitive data occurs when the 
next item in the stream is an object, the read methods return -1 or the 
EOFException as appropriate. The value of a primitive type is read by a 
DataInputStream from the block data record.
<p>The exceptions thrown reflect errors during the traversal or exceptions that 
occur on the underlying stream. If any exception is thrown, the underlying 
stream is left in an unknown and unusable state.
<p>When the reset token occurs in the stream, all of the state of the stream is 
discarded. The set of known objects is cleared.
<p>When the exception token occurs in the stream, the exception is read and a 
new WriteAbortedException is thrown with the terminating exception as an 
argument. The stream context is reset as described earlier.
<p>The <code>defaultReadObject</code> method is used to read the fields of an object from the stream. It uses the class descriptor in the stream to read the
fields by name and type from the stream. The values are assigned to the
matching fields by name in the current class. Details of the versioning
mechanism can be found in 
<a href="version.doc.html#6519">Compatible Java Type Evolution</a>. Any field
of the object that does not appear in the stream is set to its default value. Values that appear in the stream, but not in the object, are discarded. This
occurs primarily when a later version of a class has written additional fields
that do not occur in the earlier version. This method may only be called from
the <code>readObject</code> method while restoring the fields of a class.
When called at any other time, the NotActiveException is thrown.
<p>The <code>registerValidation</code> method can be called to request a callback when 
the entire graph has been restored but before the object is returned to
the original caller of <code>readObject</code>. The order of validate
callbacks can be controlled using the priority. Callbacks registered
with higher values are called before those with lower values. The
object to be validated must support the
<code>ObjectInputValidation</code> interface and implement the
<code>validateObject</code> method. It is only correct to register
validations during a call to a class's <code>readObject</code> method.
Otherwise, a NotActiveException is thrown. If the callback object
supplied to registerValidation is null, an InvalidObjectException is
thrown.
<p>The <code>resolveClass</code> method is called while a class is
being deserialized, and after the class descriptor has been read.
Subclasses may extend this method to read other information about the
class written by the corresponding subclass of
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code>. The method must find and return the
class with the given name and serialVersionUID. The default
implementation locates the class by calling the class loader of the
closest caller of <code>readObject</code> that has a class loader. If
the class cannot be found <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> should be
thrown.
<p>The <code>resolveObject</code> method is used by trusted subclasses
to enable the monitoring or substitution of one object for another
during deserialization.  Resolving objects must be enabled explicitly
by calling <code>enableResolveObject</code> before calling
<code>readObject</code> for the first object to be resolved. Once
enabled <code>resolveObject</code> is called once for each serializable
object just prior to the first time it is being returned from
readObject. A subclass's implementation may return a substitute object
that will be assigned or returned instead of the original. The object
returned must be of a type that is consistent and assignable to every
reference to the original object or else a
<code>ClassCastException</code> is thrown. All assignments are
type-checked. All references in the stream to the original object will
be replaced by references to the substitute object.
<p>The <code>enableResolveObject</code> method is used by trusted
subclasses of ObjectOutputStream to enable the monitoring or
substitution of one object for another during deserialization.
Replacing objects is disabled until <code>enableResolveObject</code> is
called with a <code>true</code> value. It may thereafter be disabled by
setting it to <code>false</code>. The previous setting is returned. The
enableResolveObject method checks that the stream requesting to do
replacement can be trusted. Every reference to deserialized objects is
passed to the resolveObject method. To ensure that the private state of
objects is not unintentionally exposed, only trusted streams may use
resolveObject. Trusted classes are those classes with a class loader
equals null.
<p>The <code>readStreamHeader</code> method reads and verifies the
magic number and version of the stream. If they do not match, the
<code>StreamCorruptedMismatch</code> is thrown.
<p><h1><a name="3403"> The ObjectInputValidation Interface
</a></h1>       This interface allows an object to be called when a
complete graph of objects has been deserialized. If the object cannot
be made valid, it should throw the <code>ObjectInvalidException</code>.
Any exception that occurs during a call to validateObject will
terminate the validation process, and the InvalidObjectException will
be thrown.
<p><dl><pre>package java.io;

public interface ObjectInputValidation
{
	public void validateObject()
		throws InvalidObjectException;
}
</pre></dl><h1><a name="2971">
The readObject Method
</a></h1>For Serializable objects, the <code>readObject</code> method allows a class to control the 
deserialization of its own fields. Here is its signature:
<p><dl><pre>	private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream)
		throws IOException;
</pre></dl>
Each subclass of a Serializable object may define its own readObject method. If 
a class does not implement the method, the default serialization provided by 
defaultReadObject will be used. When implemented, the class is only 
responsible for restoring its own fields, not those of its supertypes or subtypes.
<p>The class's readObject method, if implemented, is responsible for
restoring the state of the class. The <code>defaultReadObject</code>
method should be called before reading any optional data written by the
corresponding <code>writeObject</code> method. If an attempt is made to
read more data than is present in the optional part of the stream for
this class, the stream will throw an EOFException. The responsibility
for the format, structure, and versioning of the optional data lies
completely with the class.
<p>If the class being restored is not present in the stream being read, its fields are initialized to the appropriate default values.
<p><h1><a name="4602"> The readExternal Method </a></h1>Objects
implementing <code>java.io.Externalizable</code> must implement
the<code> readExternal</code> method to restore the entire state of the
object. It must coordinate with its superclasses to restore their
state. All of the methods of <code>ObjectInput</code> are available to
restore the object's primitive typed fields and object fields.
<p><dl><pre>	public void readExternal(ObjectInput stream)
		throws IOException;
</pre></dl><em>The <code>readExternal</code> method is public, and it raises the risk of a client 
being able to overwrite an existing object from a stream.
