Class Descriptors	

</a></h1>
<hr><p>
<p>The <code>ObjectStreamClass</code> provides information about classes that are saved in 
a Serialization stream. The descriptor provides the fully-qualified name of the 
class and its serialization version UID. A streamVersionUID identifies the 
unique original class version for which this class is capable of writing streams 
and from which it can read. 
<p><dl><pre>package java.io;

public class ObjectStreamClass
{
	public static ObjectStreamClass lookup(Class cl);

	public String getName();

	public Class forClass();

	public long getSerialVersionUID();

	public String toString();
}
</pre></dl>The <code>lookup</code> method returns the <code>ObjectStreamClass</code> descriptor for the 
specified class in the Java VM. If the class has defined serialVersionUID it is 
retrieved from the class. If not defined by the class it is computed from the 
class's definition in the Java Virtual Machine. <strong>null</strong> is returned if the specified 
class is not Serializable or Externalizable. Only class descriptions for classes 
that implement the java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces can 
be written to a stream.
<p>The <code>getName</code> method returns the fully-qualified name of the class. The class 
name is saved in the stream and is used when the class must be loaded.
<p>The <code>forClass</code> method returns the Class in the local Virtual Machine if one is 
known. Otherwise, it returns null.
<p>The <code>getSerialVersionUID</code> method returns the serialVersionUID of this 
class.   Refer to <a href="class.doc.html#4100">Stream Unique Identifiers</a>. If not specified by the 
class, the value returned is a hash computed from the class's name, interfaces, 
methods, and fields using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) as defined by the 
National Institute of Standard.
<p>The <code>toString</code> method returns a printable representation of the class 
descriptor including the class's name and serialVersionUID.
<p><h1><a name="3127">
Inspecting Serializable Classes
</a></h1>The program <code>serialver</code> can be used to find out if a class is serializable and to 
get its <code>serialVersionUID</code>. When invoked with -show it puts up a simple 
user interface. To find out if a class is serializable and to find out its 
<code>serialVersionUID,</code> enter its full class name and press either the Enter or the 
Show button. The string printed can be copied and pasted into the evolved 
class.
<p><a name="5003">
 <center><img src="class.doc.anc.gif"></center><p>
</a>When invoked on the command line with one or more class names, serialver 
prints the serialVersionUID for each class in a form suitable for copying into an 
evolving class. When invoked with no arguments, it prints a usage line.
<p><h1><a name="4100">
Stream Unique Identifiers
</a></h1>Each versioned class must identify the original class version for which it is 
capable of writing streams and from which it can read. For example, a 
versioned class must declare:
<p><dl><pre>	static final long SerialVersionUID = 3487495895819393L;
</pre></dl>The stream-unique identifier is a 64-bit hash of the class name, interface class 
names, methods, and fields. The value must be declared in all versions of a 
class except the first. It may be declared in the original class but is not 
required. The value is fixed for all compatible classes. If the SUID is not 
declared for a class, the value defaults to the hash for that class. Classes do not 
need to anticipate versioning.
<p>The serialVersionUID is computed using the signature of a stream of bytes that 
reflect the class definition. The National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) is used to compute a signature for the 
stream. The first two 32-bit quantities are used to form a 64-bit hash. A 
java.lang.DataOutputStream is used to convert primitive data types to a 
sequence of bytes. The values input to the stream are defined by the Java 
virtual machine (VM) specification for classes. The sequence of items in the 
stream is as follows:
<p><ol>
<li>The class name written using UTF encoding.
<li>The class modifiers written as a 32-bit integer.
<li>The name of each interface sorted by name written using UTF encoding.
<li>For each field of the class sorted by field name (except private static and 
private transient fields):
<ul>
<li>The name of the field in UTF encoding.
<li>The modifiers of the field written as an 32-bit integer.
<li>The descriptor of the field in UTF encoding.
</ul>
<li>For each method including constructors sorted by method name and 
signature, except private methods and constructors:
<ul>
<li>The name of the method in UTF encoding.
<li>The modifiers of the method written as an 32-bit integer.
<li>The descriptor of the method in UTF encoding.
</ul>
<li>The SHA-1 algorithm is executed on the stream of bytes produced by 
DataOutputStream and produces five 32-bit values sha[0..4].
<li>The hash value is assembled from the first and second 32-bit values.
     long hash = sha[1] &lt;&lt; 32 + sha[0].
