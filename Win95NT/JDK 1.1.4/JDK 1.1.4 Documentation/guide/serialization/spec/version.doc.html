Overview
</a></h1>When Java objects use serialization to save state in files, or as blobs in 
databases, the potential arises that the version of a class reading the data is 
different than the version that wrote the data.
<p>Versioning raises some fundamental questions about the identity of a class, 
including what constitutes a compatible change. A <em>compatible change</em> is a change 
that does not affect the contract between the class and its callers.
<p>This section describes the goals, assumptions, and a solution that attempts to 
address this problem by restricting the kinds of changes allowed and by 
carefully choosing the mechanisms.
<p>The proposed solution provides a mechanism for "automatic" handling of 
classes that evolve by adding fields and adding 	classes. Serialization will 
handle versioning without class-specific methods to be implemented for each 
version. The stream format can be traversed without invoking class-specific 
methods.
<p><h1><a name="4569">
Goals
</a></h1>The goals are to:
<p><ul><li>Support bidirectional communication between different versions of a class 
operating in different virtual machines by:
<ul>
<li>Defining a mechanism that allows Java classes to read streams written by 
older versions of the same class.
<li>Defining a mechanism that allows Java classes to write streams intended 
to be read by older versions of the same class.
</ul>
<li>Provide default serialization for persistence and for RMI.
<li>Perform well and produce compact streams in simple cases, so that RMI can 
use serialization.
<li>Be able to identify and load classes that match the exact class used to write 
the stream.
<li>Keep the overhead low for nonversioned classes.
<li>Use a stream format that allows the traversal of the stream without having 
to invoke methods specific to the objects saved in the stream.
</ul><h1><a name="4595">
Assumptions
</a></h1>The assumptions are that:
<p><ul><li>Versioning will only apply to serializable classes since it must control the 
stream format to achieve it goals. Externalizable classes will be responsible 
for their own versioning which is tied to the external format.
<li>All data and objects must be read from, or skipped in, the stream in the 
same order as they were written.
<li>Classes evolve individually as well as in concert with supertypes and 
subtypes.
<li>Classes are identified by name. Two classes with the same name may be 
different versions or completely different classes that can be distinguished 
only by comparing their interfaces or by comparing hashes of the interfaces.
<li>Default serialization will not perform any type conversions.
<li>The stream format only needs to support a linear sequence of type changes, 
not arbitrary branching of a type.
</ul><h1><a name="4602">
Who's Responsible for Versioning of Streams
</a></h1>In the evolution of classes, it is the responsibility of the evolved (later version) 
class to maintain the contract established by the nonevolved class. This takes 
two forms. First, the evolved class must not break the existing assumptions 
about the interface provided by the original version, so that the evolved class 
can be used in place of the original. Secondly, when communicating with the 
original (or previous) versions, the evolved class must provide sufficient and 
equivalent information to allow the earlier version to continue to satisfy the 
nonevolved contract.
<p><center><img src="version.doc.anc.gif"></center>
<p>For the purposes of the discussion here, each class implements and extends the 
interface or contract defined by its supertype. New versions of a class, for 
example foo', must continue to satisfy the contract for foo and may extend the 
interface or modify its implementation. 
<p>Communication between objects via serialization is not part of the contract 
defined by these interfaces. Serialization is a private protocol between the 
implementations. It is the responsibility of the implementations to 
communicate sufficiently to allow each implementation to continue to satisfy 
the contract expected by its clients.
<p><h1><a name="6519">
Compatible Java Type Evolution
</a></h1>In the <em>Java Language Specification</em>, Chapter 13 discusses binary compatibility of 
Java classes as those classes evolve. Most of the flexibility of binary 
compatibility comes from the use of late binding of symbolic references for the 
names of classes, interfaces, fields, methods, and so on. 
<p>The following are the principle aspects of the design for versioning of 
serialized object streams.
<p><ul><li>The default serialization mechanism will use a symbolic model for binding 
the fields in the stream to the fields in the corresponding class in the virtual 
machine.
<li>Each class referenced in the stream will uniquely identify itself, its 
supertype, and the types and names of each nonstatic and nontransient field 
written to the stream. The fields are ordered with the primitive types first 
sorted by field name, followed by the object fields sorted by field name.
<li>Two types of data may occur in the stream for each class: required data 
(corresponding directly to the nonstatic and nontransient fields of the 
object); and optional data (consisting of an arbitrary sequence of primitives 
and objects). The stream format defines how the required and optional data 
occur in the stream so that the whole class, the required, or the optional 
parts can be skipped if necessary.
<ul>
<li>The required data consists of the fields of the object in the order defined 
by the class descriptor. 
<li>The optional data is written to the stream and does not correspond 
directly to fields of the class. The class itself is responsible for the length, 
types, and versioning of this optional information.
</ul>
<li>If defined for a class, the writeObject/readObject methods supersede the 
default mechanism to write/read the state of the class. These methods write 
and read the optional data for a class. The required data is written by calling 
<code>defaultWriteObject</code> and read by calling <code>defaultReadObject</code>.
<li>The stream format of each class is identified by the use of a Stream Unique 
Identifier (SUID). By default, this is the hash of the class. All later versions 
of the class must declare the Stream Unique Identifier (SUID) that they are 
compatible with. This guards against classes with the same name that might 
inadvertently be identified as being versions of a single class.
<li>Subtypes of ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream may include their 
own information identifying the class using the annotateClass method; for 
example, MarshalOutputStream embeds the URL of the class.
</ul><h1><a name="6678">
Type Changes Affecting Serialization
</a></h1>With these concepts, we can now describe how the design will cope with the 
different cases of an evolving class. The cases are described in terms of a 
stream written by some version of a class. When the stream is read back by the 
same version of the class, there is no loss of information or functionality. The 
stream is the only source of information about the original class. Its class 
descriptions, while a subset of the original class description, are sufficient to 
match up the data in the stream with the version of the class being 
reconstituted.
<p>The descriptions are from the perspective of the stream being read in order to 
reconstitute either an earlier or later version of the class. In the parlance of RPC 
systems, this is a "receiver makes right" system. The writer writes its data in 
the most suitable form and the receiver must interpret that information to 
extract the parts it needs and to fill in the parts that are not available.
<p><h2><a name="5172">
Incompatible Changes
</a></h2>Incompatible changes to classes are those changes for which the guarantee of 
interoperability cannot be maintained. The incompatible changes that may 
occur while evolving a class are:
<p><ul><li>Deleting fields - If a field is deleted in a class, the stream written will not 
contain its value. When the stream is read by an earlier class, the value of 
the field will be set to the default value because no value is available in the 
stream. However, this default value may adversely impair the ability of the 
earlier version to fulfill its contract.
<li>Moving classes up or down the hierarchy - This cannot be allowed since the 
data in the stream appears in the wrong sequence.
<li>Changing a nonstatic field to static or a nontransient field to transient - This 
is equivalent to deleting a field from the class. This version of the class will 
not write that data to the stream, so it will not be available to be read by 
earlier versions of the class. As when deleting a field, the field of the earlier 
version will be initialized to the default value, which can cause the class to 
fail in unexpected ways.
<li>Changing the declared type of a primitive field - Each version of the class 
writes the data with its declared type. Earlier versions of the class 
attempting to read the field will fail because the type of the data in the 
stream does not match the type of the field.
<li>Changing the writeObject or readObject method so that it no longer writes 
or reads the default field data or changing it so that it attempts to write it or 
read it when the previous version did not. The default field data must 
consistently either appear or not appear in the stream.
<li>Changing a class from Serializable to Externalizable or visa-versa is an 
incompatible change since the stream will contain data that is incompatible 
with the implementation in the available class.
<li>Removing either Serializable or Externalizable is an incompatible change 
since when written it will not longer supply the fields needed by older 
versions of the class.
</ul><h2><a name="6754">
Compatible Changes
</a></h2>The compatible changes to a class are handled as follows:
<p><ul><li>Adding fields - When the class being reconstituted has a field that does not 
occur in the stream, that field in the object will be initialized to the default 
value for its type. If class-specific initialization is needed, the class may 
provide a readObject method that can initialize the field to nondefault 
values.
<li>Adding classes - The stream will contain the type hierarchy of each object in 
the stream. Comparing this hierarchy in the stream with the current class 
can detect additional classes. Since there is no information in the stream 
from which to initialize the object, the class's fields will be initialized to the 
default values.
<li>Removing classes - Comparing the class hierarchy in the stream with that of 
the current class can detect that a class has been deleted. In this case, the 
fields and objects corresponding to that class are read from the stream. 
Primitive fields are discarded, but the objects referenced by the deleted class 
are created, since they may be referred to later in the stream. They will be 
garbage-collected when the stream is garbage-collected or reset.
<li>Adding writeObject/readObject methods - If the version reading the stream 
has these methods then readObject is expected, as usual, to read the 
required data written to the stream by the default serialization. It should call 
<code>defaultReadObject</code> first before reading any optional data. The 
<code>writeObject</code> method is expected as usual to call <code>defaultWriteObject</code> 
to write the required data and then may write optional data.
<li>Removing writeObject/readObject methods - If the class reading the stream 
does not have these methods, the required data will be read by default 
serialization, and the optional data will be discarded.
<li>Adding java.io.Serializable - This is equivalent to adding types. There will 
be no values in the stream for this class so its fields will be initialized to 
default values. The support for subclassing nonserializable classes requires 
that the class's supertype have a no-arg constructor and the class itself will 
be initialized to default values. If the no-arg constructor is not available, the 
NotSerializableException is thrown.
<li>Removing java.io.Serializable so that it is no longer Serializable - This is 
equivalent to removing the class, and it can be dealt with by reading and 
discarding data for the class.
<li>Changing the access to a field - The access modifiers public, package, 
protected, and private have no effect on the ability of serialization to assign 
values to the fields.
<li>Changing a field from static to nonstatic or transient to nontransient - This is 
equivalent to adding a field to the class. The new field will be written to the 
stream but earlier classes will ignore the value since serialization will not 
assign values to static or transient fields.
