The ObjectOutputStream Class
</a></h1>Class <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> implements object serialization. It maintains the 
state of the stream including the set of objects already serialized. Its methods 
control the traversal of objects to be serialized to save the specified objects and 
the objects to which they refer.

</pre></dl>The <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> constructor requires an OutputStream. The 
constructor calls <code>writeStreamHeader</code> to write a magic number and version 
to the stream, that will be read and verified by the corresponding 
<code>readStreamHeader</code> in the <code>ObjectInputStream</code> constructor.
<p>The <code>writeObject</code> method is used to serialize an object to the stream. Objects 
are serialized as follows:
<p><ol>
<li>If there is data in the block-data buffer, it is written to the stream and the 
buffer is reset.
<li>If the object is null, null is put in the stream and writeObject returns.
<li>If the object has already been written to the stream, its handle is written to 
the stream and writeObject returns. If the object has been already been 
replaced, the handle for the previously-written replacement object is written 
to the stream.
<li>If the object is a Class, the corresponding ObjectStreamClass is written to the 
stream, a handle is assigned for the class, and writeObject returns.
<li>If the object is an ObjectStreamClass, a descriptor for the class is written to 
the stream including its name, serialVersionUID, and the list of fields by 
name and type. A handle is assigned for the descriptor. The annotateClass 
subclass method is called before <code>writeObject</code> returns.
<li>If the object is a <code>java.lang.String,</code> the string is written in Universal 
Transfer Format (UTF) format, a handle is assigned to the string, and 
writeObject returns.
<li>If the object is an array, <code>writeObject</code> is called recursively to write the 
<code>ObjectStreamClass</code> of the array. The handle for the array is assigned. It is 
followed by the length of the array. Each element of the array is then written 
to the stream, after which <code>writeObject</code> returns.
<li>If enabled by calling <code>enableReplaceObject</code>, the <code>replaceObject</code> method 
is called to allow subclasses to substitute an object. If the object is replaced, 
the mapping from the original object to the replacement is stored for later 
use in step 3, and steps 2 through 7 are repeated on the new object. If the 
replacement object is not one of the types covered by steps 2 through 7, 
processing resumes using the replacement object at step 9.
<li>For regular objects, the ObjectStreamClass for the object's class is written by 
recursively calling writeObject. It will appear in the stream only the first 
time it is referenced. A handle is assigned for this object.
<li>The contents of the object is written to the stream.
<ul>
<li>If the object is Serializable, the highest Serializable class is located. For that 
class, and each derived class, that class's fields are written. If the class 
does not have a <code>writeObject</code> method, the <code>defaultWriteObject</code> 
method is called to write the nonstatic and nontransient fields to the 
stream. If the class does have a <code>writeObject</code> method, it is called. It may 
call <code>defaultWriteObject</code> to save the state of the object, and then it can 
write other information to the stream.
<li>If the object is <code>Externalizable</code>, the writeExternal method of the object 
is called.
<li>If the object is neither Serializable or Externalizable, the 
NotSerializableException is thrown.
</ul>
</ol>
Exceptions may occur during the traversal or may occur in the underlying 
stream. For any subclass of <code>ObjectStreamException</code> the exception is 
written to the stream using the exception protocol and the stream state is 
discarded. For other <code>exceptions</code>, the stream is aborted and left in an 
unknown and unusable state. 
<p>The <code>defaultWriteObject</code> method implements the default serialization 
mechanism for the current class. This method may be called only from a class's 
<code>writeObject</code> method. The method writes all of the nonstatic and 
nontransient fields of the current class to the stream. If called from outside the 
<code>writeObject</code> method, the NotActiveException is thrown.
<p>The <code>reset</code> method resets the stream state to be the same as if it had just been 
constructed. Reset will discard the state of any objects already written to the 
stream. The current point in the stream is marked as reset, so the 
corresponding ObjectInputStream will reset at the same point. Objects 
previously written to the stream will not be remembered as already having 
been written to the stream. They will be written to the stream again. This is 
useful when the contents of an object or objects must be sent again. Reset may 
not be called while objects are being serialized. If called inappropriately, an 
IOException is thrown.
<p>The <code>annotateClass</code> method is called while a Class is being serialized, and 
after the class descriptor has been written to the stream. Subclasses may extend 
this method and write other information to the stream about the class. This 
information must be read by the <code>resolveClass</code> method in a corresponding 
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> subclass.
<p>The <code>replaceObject</code> method is used by trusted subclasses to allow objects 
within the graph to be replaced or monitored during serialization. Replacing 
objects must be enabled explicitly by calling <code>enableReplaceObject</code> before 
calling <code>writeObject</code> with the first object to be replaced. Once enabled, 
<code>replaceObject</code> is called for each object just prior to serializing the object for 
the first time. A subclass's implementation may return a substitute object that 
will be serialized instead of the original. The substitute object must be 
serializable. All references in the stream to the original object will be replaced 
by the substitute object.
<p>When objects are being replaced, the subclass must ensure that the substituted 
object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored, or that 
a complementary substitution will be made during deserialization. Objects, 
whose type is not a subclass of the type of the field or array element, will later 
abort the deserialization by raising a <code>ClassCastException</code> and the reference 
will not be stored.
<p>The <code>enableReplaceObject</code> method is used by trusted subclasses of 
ObjectOutputStream to enable the substitution of one object for another during 
serialization. Replacing objects is disabled until <code>enableReplaceObject</code> is 
called with a <code>true</code> value. It may thereafter be disabled by setting it to <code>false</code>. 
The previous setting is returned. The <code>enableReplaceObject</code> method checks 
that the stream requesting the replacement can be trusted. Every reference to 
objects is passed to <code>replaceObject</code>. To ensure that the private state of objects 
is not unintentionally exposed, only trusted streams may use <code>replaceObject</code>. 
Trusted classes are those classes with a class loader equal to null.
<p>The <code>writeStreamHeader</code> method writes the magic number and version to 
the stream. This information must be read by the <code>readStreamHeader</code> method 
of <code>ObjectInputStream</code>. Subclasses may need to implement this method to 
identify the stream's unique format.
<p>The <code>flush</code> method is used to empty any buffers being held by the stream and 
to forward the flush to the underlying stream. The <code>drain</code> method may be used 
by subclassers to empty only the <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>'s buffers without 
forcing the underlying stream to be flushed.
<p>All of the write methods for primitive types encode their values using a 
DataOutputStream to put them in the standard stream format. The bytes are 
buffered into block data records so they can be distinguished from the 
encoding of objects. This buffering allows primitive data to be skipped if 
necessary for class versioning. It also allows the stream to be parsed without 
invoking class-specific methods.
<p><h1><a name="861">
The writeObject Method
</a></h1>	For Serializable objects, the <code>writeObject</code> method allows a class to control the 
serialization of its own fields. Here is its signature:
<p><dl><pre>	private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream stream)
		throws IOException;
</pre></dl>Each subclass of a Serializable object may define its own writeObject method. 
If a class does not implement the method, the default serialization provided by 
defaultWriteObject will be used. When implemented, the class is only 
responsible for saving its own fields, not those of its supertypes or subtypes.
<p>The class's writeObject method, if implemented, is responsible for saving the 
state of the class. The <code>defaultWriteObject</code> method should be called before 
writing any optional data that will be needed by the corresponding 
<code>readObject</code> method to restore the state of the object. The responsibility for 
the format, structure, and versioning of the optional data lies completely with 
the class.
<p><h1><a name="3146">
The writeExternal Method
</a></h1>Objects implementing <code>java.io.Externalizable</code> must implement the 
<code>writeExternal</code> method to save the entire state of the object. It must 
coordinate with its superclasses to save their state. All of the methods of 
<code>ObjectOutput</code> are available to save the object's primitive typed fields and 
object fields.
