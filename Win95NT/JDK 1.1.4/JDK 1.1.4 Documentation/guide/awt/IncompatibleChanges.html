<h1>
Incompatible Changes in the 1.1 AWT API
</h1>

As a rule, 
code written for the 1.0, 1.0.1, and 1.0.2 releases
can be compiled without change in the 1.1 release
(although you might see some warnings about "deprecated" API).
Also, code compiled under those earlier releases
generally works (without recompilation)
at least as well in a 1.1 runtime system as it did before.
This document lists the AWT exceptions to these rules 
-- the changes that might cause incompatible
compilation or runtime behavior.
For information about non-AWT JDK 1.1 compatibility, see
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/compatibility.html">JDK 1.1
Compatibility with Previous JDK Releases.</a>

<p>

Here are the incompatible AWT changes:

<ol>
<li> On Windows 95/NT systems,
     menus no longer allow keyboard alternatives, 
     known as <em>mnemonics</em>.
     Due to an implementation flaw,
     you used to be able to specify mnemonics in Windows 95/NT
     by putting an ampersand ("&") 
     in the menu label.
     For example, a menu item with the label "Save &As..."
     defined "a" as the mnemonic 
     and would result in "A" being underlined
     in the displayed menu item --
     but only on Windows 95/NT.
     Now, menus with "&" in the label simply display the "&"
     on Windows 95/NT,
     as they always have on other platforms.
     The reason the "&" hack no longer works
     is that it depended on the AWT 
     using the native menu system,
     which it no longer does due to 
     the need to support
     modifiable fonts and
     the display of non-Latin1 text.
     We plan to add support for menu mnemonics in a future release.
<p>
<li> On Windows 95/NT systems,
     canvases and panels might seem unable to get keyboard events.
     The reason is that they no longer automatically get the focus,
     which is required for receiving keyboard events.
     To give a canvas or panel the focus,
     use the <code>requestFocus</code> method.
     For example, 
     your implementation of the <code>mouseClicked</code> method
     in the <code>MouseListener</code> for a custom component 
     should invoke the <code>requestFocus</code> method
     on the component.
<p>
<li> The following four 1.0.2 methods
     in the <code>java.awt.peer</code> package
     have been removed in 1.1:
     <ul> 
	<li><code>java.awt.peer.ComponentPeer:<br>
	public abstract boolean handleEvent(java.awt.Event);
	<br>
	public abstract void nextFocus();</code>

	<li><code>java.awt.peer.ScrollbarPeer:<br>
	public abstract void setValue(int);</code>

	<li><code>java.awt.peer.FramePeer:<br>
	public abstract void setCursor(int);</code>
     </ul>
     <strong>Note:</strong>
     API in the <code>java.awt.peer</code> package
     is always subject to change
     because the peer classes aren't intended 
     to be called directly by developers.
<p>
<li> Trying to add a window to a container
     now results in an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
<p>
<li> The <code>Graphics</code> <code>drawPolygon</code> method
     used to draw unclosed polygons if the end point
     wasn't the same as the start point.
     In 1.1, <code>drawPolygon</code> automatically closes the polygon.
     If you want to draw an unclosed polygon,
     you can use the new <code>drawPolyline</code> method instead.
<p>
<li> Constructors for the <code>Color</code> class now check
     the range of the parameters passed in,
     and throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
     if out-of-range values are encountered.
<p>
<li> Passing a null frame to a <code>Dialog</code> constructor
     now results in an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
<p>
<li> The public abstract method <code>nextFocus</code>
     has been removed from the 
     <code>java.awt.peer.ComponentPeer</code>
     interface.
     This does not affect applications or applets,
     since the peer interfaces are private interfaces
     between the AWT and its implementations.
<p>
<li> Bug fixes in Win32 event handling might mean
     that your components get more events than they used to.
     Details are in the
     <a href=#win32Events>Improvements in Win32 Event Handling</a>
     section below.
<p>
<li> The synchronization model of the AWT
     has been revised to reduce the potential of deadlock.
     This might result in different behavior of existing programs.
     Details are in the 
     <a href=#sync>Details of the New Synchronization Model</a>
     section below.
</ol>
<p>


<h3>
<a name=win32Events>
Improvements in Win32 Event Handling
</a>
</h3>
Many bugs were fixed in the event handling of the win32 implementation
of the AWT.  In particular, focus events were previously not delivered
to certain components (buttons, etc.) in 1.0.2, but are now properly
delivered on win32 in 1.1.   If you have a <code>handleEvent</code> method
which is not
coded properly to handle these new events, you may see changes in the
way your program runs.  For example, if you had the following fragment
in the <code>handleEvent</code> method of a <code>Frame</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
if (event.id == Event.GOT_FOCUS) {
    // do something...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

This block will now be called when components within the <code>Frame</code>
(such as buttons) get the focus.  If the block isn't designed to handle 
this case, then your program may not run as it did in 1.0.2.


<h3>
<a name=sync>
Details of the New Synchronization Model
</a>
</h3>

The synchronization model of the AWT has been revised to
significantly reduce (but not eliminate) the potential of deadlock
that existed in the 1.0.2 JDK.  This is not, strictly speaking, an
incompatibility with previous releases, but it does have the potential
to change the behavior of existing programs.  The AWT never was, and
still isn't, guaranteed to be free of race conditions or deadlocks,
given all the ways it can be invoked from and subclassed by client
code.

<p>

In the new synchronization model, the structure and layout of
components inside containers is guarded by a single AWT-wide lock,
using an object called <code>Component.LOCK</code>, declared as follows in
the <code>Component</code> class:
  
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
public static final Object LOCK = new Object();
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  
For example, <code>Container.validate</code>,
<code>Container.add</code>,
and <code>Container.remove</code>
all contain synchronized blocks
that use <code>Component.LOCK</code>.

<p>
   
Setter methods for individual component state, such as
<code>Component.setEnabled</code> or <code>Button.setLabel</code>,
are synchronized on the
instance itself.  Getter methods are generally not synchronized, but
they are semi-guarded by the copy-to-stack strategy:  a thread-local
copy of shared data is made and then used in the method.

<p>

Code that uses the AWT should be carefully scrutinized for uniform locking
order if it acquires locks of its own while overriding an AWT method
invoked in a synchronized context.  For example, if you acquire your
own locks in your layout code, you have to be aware that this code is
being called with the <code>Component.LOCK</code> lock already held.
If your code
in another thread holds your lock
and then tries to invoke <code>validate</code>,
your program can deadlock.  When you identify cases like this, you
should rewrite your code wherever possible to ensure a uniform locking
order.  This order is usually client lock first,
then <code>Component.LOCK</code>.
