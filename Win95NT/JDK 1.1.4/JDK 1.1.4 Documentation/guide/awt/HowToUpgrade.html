<h1>
How to Convert Programs to the 1.1 AWT API
</h1>

The architecture of the AWT has improved greatly in 1.1.  This
improvement required making some changes that affect compatibility. 
Specifically,
programs that use 1.1 features
<b>do not run</b>
within runtime systems that are
based on earlier releases.
However, runtime systems
based on 1.1
<b>do run</b>
programs compiled under 1.0, 1.0.1, and 1.0.2,
as long as the programs don't depend on bugs in the earlier releases.
(You can find a list of these possibly incompatible bug fixes
in the document
<a href=IncompatibleChanges.html>Incompatible Changes in the 1.1 AWT API</a>.)
Programs that use only 1.0.X features
but are compiled under 1.1
appear to run in 1.0.X runtime systems,
but this compatibility hasn't been rigorously tested
and is not guaranteed.

<p>

For example, any 1.0 applet should successfully compile under 1.1.
And whether you use the old (1.0) class files
or recompile and use new (1.1) class files,
the 1.0 applet will work in 1.1-based browsers.
Also, we believe that the new (1.1) class files
will work in old (1.0-based) browsers,
as long as you make no changes to the applet's source.
But if you change the applet to use any 1.1 feature,
the applet won't run in browsers such as Netscape 3.0
that haven't been updated to the 1.1 API.

<p>

So why should you update your programs to the 1.1 AWT API? 
Three reasons:

<ul>
<li> The 1.1 version of AWT has some new features you might want to use.
<li> The new architecture enables faster, more robust
     implementations of the AWT,
     which means that your updated program might work better.
<li> Support for the old API will eventually be phased out.
</ul>

<p>

The rest of this document explains
<a href=#awtChanges>how the AWT has changed</a> and
<a href=#awtHowTo>how to convert your program</a>.
It then provides
<a href=#example>an example</a>
of converting a program to 1.1.


<h2>
<a name=awtChanges>
How the AWT Has Changed 
</a>
</h2>

The AWT has changed in three ways:

<ul>
<li> The architecture has been improved
     to make large-scale GUI development more feasible
     and to add basic functionality that was missing.
     <p>
     Architectural support has been added for event handling by
     non-components ("delegation"), data transfer (such as
     cut-copy-paste), desktop color schemes (to improve consistency of
     appearance), mouseless operation, and component-specific cursors.
     Not all of the features associated with these architecture
     improvements have been completely implemented.  For example,
     although the data transfer architecture makes drag-and-drop
     possible, drag-and-drop isn't implemented in 1.1.
     <a href=designspec/index.html><b>JDK1.1
     - AWT Enhancements</b></a>
     has details on exactly what is implemented
     in the final 1.1 release.
<p>
<li> Method names, arguments, and functionality have been made consistent.
     <p>
     These changes make it possible for programs 
     such as GUI builders and JavaBeans-using programs
     to query components to determine the components' properties.
     They also make it easier for programmers to learn and use the AWT API.
<p>
<li> Miscellaneous quality improvements have been made and new features added.
     <p>
     For example, image and graphics functionality has improved, and the
     <code>PopupMenu</code> and <code>ScrollPane</code> classes have been added.  The <code>PopupMenu</code>
     class makes it possible to have a menu that is not attached to a
     menu bar.  The <code>ScrollPane</code> class makes implementing scrolling
     areas easy, as well as increasing the speed of scrolling.
</ul>

<p>

You can find more information on event-handling changes
<a href=#events>later in this document</a>.
See
<a href=designspec/index.html><b>JDK1.1
- AWT Enhancements</b></a>
for more complete information about how the AWT has changed.


<h2>
<a name=awtHowTo>
How to Convert Your Program
</a>
</h2>

Converting a program to the 1.1 AWT has two major phases:
<ul>
<li> Converting to the new names.
     Much of this conversion can be done automatically.
<li> Converting to the new event scheme.
</ul>

<h3>
General Instructions
</h3>
<ol>
<li> First, save a copy of the original program -- 
     both the Java source code and the Java bytecodes.
     You'll need the copy until all the Java runtime systems
     the program might execute
     in have been converted to 1.1.  For example, licensees such as
     Netscape and Microsoft might take a few months after the final
     JDK 1.1 release to update their own products to include 1.1.  For
     this reason, you might want to delay releasing a 1.1-based applet to
     the web (or provide both 1.0 and 1.1 versions)
     until you think that the applet's
     intended users have upgraded to the new release.

     Here's an example of saving a copy of a program on a UNIX system:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>cp MyClass.java MyClass.java.orig</b>
% <b>cp MyClass.class MyClass.class.orig</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li> Convert your source code --
     automatically if possible --
     so that it uses the new names for methods
     whose names have changed.

     <p>

     We provide a 
     <a href=updateAWT><code>sed</code> script</a>
     that performs much of the conversion automatically.
     (For details on what the script converts,
     see <a href=NameChanges.html>Simple Name Changes</a>.)
     The script is designed for the UNIX <code>sed</code> command.
     If you're developing on a PC,
     you might be able to run the script
     using a product such as MKS Toolkit,
     which provides PC versions of UNIX tools.
     Here's how to use the <code>sed</code> script
     at a shell prompt on a UNIX system:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>updateAWT MyClass.java > tmp.java</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
     <p>
     Check the changes to make sure nothing obviously bad happened. 
     For example, on a UNIX system,
     you might execute the following command:
     <p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>diff MyClass.java tmp.java</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
And then after confirming that the changes look OK:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>mv tmp.java MyClass.java</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li> Try to compile the program under 1.1. 
     Make <em>sure</em> you're using a 1.1 compiler.
     Here's an example of compiling on a UNIX system:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>javac MyClass.java</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
     <p>
     You might see compilation errors or warnings.
     The most common ones 
     warn you that your program uses a deprecated method
     or uses a method that couldn't be found.
     <p>
     If your program
     calls any deprecated methods --
     pre-1.1 methods whose use we discourage for some reason --
     the compiler displays a warning.
     For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>javac MyClass.java</b>
Note: MyClass.java uses a deprecated API.  Recompile with "-deprecation"
for details.
1 warning
%
</pre>
</blockquote>
     <p>

     <strong>Note:</strong> 
     The 1.1.1 Java compiler warns you  
     when a program overrides a deprecated method,
     but the 1.1 compiler does not.
     The 1.1 compiler warns you only
     when a program <em>calls</em> a deprecated method. 
     For example, the 1.1 compiler won't usually warn you
     if a program overrides the <code>action</code> method,
     since most implementations of <code>action</code> 
     don't call the superclass's implementation.

     <p>
     To get information about each source file's
     use of deprecated methods,
     use the <code>-deprecation</code> option of the Java compiler.
     For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>javac -deprecation MyClass.java</b>
MyClass.java:18: Note: The method boolean handleEvent(java.awt.Event) in
class java.awt.Component has been deprecated, and class MyClass overrides
it.
    public boolean handleEvent(Event event) {
                   ^
MyClass.java:26: Note: The method boolean handleEvent(java.awt.Event) in
class java.awt.Component has been deprecated.
        return super.handleEvent(event);
                                ^
Note: MyClass.java uses a deprecated API.  Please consult the
documentation for a better alternative.
2 warnings
</pre>
</blockquote>
     <p>
     You can consult
     <a href=DeprecatedMethods.html>Deprecated Methods in the 1.1 AWT</a>
     for information about alternatives to each deprecated method.
     (It refers you back to this document 
     for information on event-related methods.)

     <p>
     If you get a compilation error saying
     that a method couldn't be found,
     then the <code>sed</code> script might have incorrectly changed
     the name of a method.
     See <a href=NameChanges.html>Simple Name Changes</a>
     for help in correcting the problem.
<p>
<li> Make remaining changes by hand
     until the program compiles without warnings.
     Most of the changes that you're likely to make by hand
     involve converting to the 1.1 event model.
     This document gives you an 
     overview of the 1.1 event model and tells you
     how to convert event-handling code.
<p>
<li> Test your program by executing it.
</ol>
   

<h3>
<a name=events>
How to Convert Event-Handling Code
</a>
</h3>

First, let's review how event handling happened before 1.1.  Before
1.1, the <code>Component handleEvent</code> method
(along with the methods it called, such as <code>action</code>)
was the center of event handling.  Only
<code>Component</code> objects could handle events, and the component that handled
an event had to be either the component in which the event occurred or a
component above it in the component containment hierarchy.

<p>

In 1.1,
event handling is no longer restricted
to objects in the component containment hierarchy,
and the <code>handleEvent</code> method
is no longer the center of event handling,
Instead, objects of any type can register as
event listeners.  Event listeners receive notification only about the
types of events they've registered their interest in.  Never again will you
have to create a <code>Component</code> subclass just to handle events.

<p>

When upgrading to the 1.1 release,
the simplest way to convert event-handling code
is to leave it in the same class,
making that class a listener for that type of event.

<p>

Another possibility is to centralize event-handling code
in one or more non-Component listeners.
This approach lets you separate the GUI of your program
from implementation details,
It requires that you modify your existing code 
so that the listeners can get whatever state information
they require from the components.
This approach can be worth your while
if you're trying to keep your program's architecture clean.

<p>

A third possibility,
which we don't recommend unless you're already extending a Component,
is to override one of the <code>process<em>Xxx</em></code> methods.
This and the other event-handling approaches
are discussed in the design document
<a href=designspec/events.html><b>Delegation Event Model</b></a>.

<p>

We recommend that you do <b>not</b> mix
the 1.0 event model 
with the 1.1 event model in the same program.
The results would be unpredictable
and might be difficult to debug.

<h4>
<a name=listener>
Making a Component a Listener
</a>
</h4>

The biggest part of converting most 1.0 AWT-using programs
to the 1.1 API
is converting the event-handling code.
The process can be straightforward,
once you figure out which events a program handles
and which components generate the events.
If you're using the 1.1.1 Java compiler,
compiling with the <code>-deprecation</code> flag
generates a list 
that includes all old-style event handling methods.
(Before 1.1.1, the compiler didn't generate a complete list,
so you had to search for "Event" in a source file.)
While you're looking at the code,
you should note whether any classes
exist solely for the purpose
of handling events;
you might be able to eliminate such classes.

<p>

Here are the steps to follow
when converting a 1.0 component 
into a listener:

<ul>
<li> Change the source file so that it imports
     the <code>java.awt.event</code> package:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>import java.awt.event.*</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li> Figure out which components generate each event type.
     The <a href=#table>table</a> at the end of this document
     can help you know what to look for.
     For example, if you're converting event code
     that's in an <code>action</code> method,
     the table at the end of this document tells you to look for
     <code>Button</code>,
     <code>List</code>,
     <code>MenuItem</code>,
     <code>TextField</code>,
     <code>Checkbox</code>, and
     <code>Choice</code> objects.
<p>
<li> Change the class declaration
     so that the class implements
     the appropriate listener interfaces
     (as listed by
     the <a href=#table>table</a> at the end of this document).
     For example, if you're trying to handle an action event
     generated by a <code>Button</code>,
     the table
     tells you to implement the <code>ActionListener</code> interface.
<blockquote>
<pre>
public class MyClass extends SomeComponent
             <b>implements ActionListener</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<strong>Alternative:</strong>
Instead of implementing an interface, 
you can declare an inner class
that extends an event adapter class.
Inner classes are useful 
when you need to implement only one method
of an interface,
but the interface contains many other methods.
See
<a href="#innerClass">Using Inner Classes for Event Handling</a>
for more information.

<p>
<li> Determine where the components that generate the events are created.
     Just after the code that creates each one,
     register <code>this</code> as the appropriate type of listener.
     For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b><em>newComponentObject</em>.addActionListener(this);</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alternative:</strong>
If you use an inner class to handle the events,
register an instance of that inner class instead.
See
<a href="#innerClass">Using Inner Classes for Event Handling</a>
for more information.

<p>
<li> Create empty implementations of all the methods
     in the listener interfaces your class must implement.
     Copy the event-handling code
     into the appropriate methods.
     For example, 
     <code>ActionListener</code> has just one method,
     <code>actionPerformed</code>.
     So as a shortcut way of creating
     the new method 
     and copying the event-handling code to it, 
     you can simply change the signature
     of an <code>action</code> method from this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public boolean action(Event event, Object arg) {
</pre>
</blockquote>
     to this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent <em>event</em>) {</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alternative:</strong>
If you use an inner class to handle the events,
you don't need to create empty implementations of methods.
See
<a href="#innerClass">Using Inner Classes for Event Handling</a>
for more information.

<p>
<li> Modify the event-handling code in these ways:
     <ul>
     <li> Delete all <code>return</code> statements.
     <li> Change references to <code><em>event</em>.target</code>
	  to be <code><em>event</em>.getSource()</code>.
     <li> Delete any code that unnecessarily tests for 
	  which component the event came from.
	  (Now that events are forwarded
	  only if the generating component has a listener,
	  you don't have to worry about receiving events
	  from an unwanted component.)
     <li> Perform any other modifications required
          to make the program compile cleanly and execute correctly.
     </ul>
</ul>

<h4>
<a name="innerClass">
Using Inner Classes for Event Handling
</a>
</h4>

Inner classes are useful
when you need to implement an interface
that contains many methods,
but you want to implement only one or two of the methods.
This section tells you how to write an event handler 
using an inner class,
without getting into details about inner classes in general.
For general information about inner classes, see
<a href="../innerclasses/index.html"><b>Inner Classes</b></a>.

<p>

Implementing an event-handling inner class is a variation 
on making a class implement an event-listener interface.
As before, you determine which interface 
corresponds to the events your class needs to handle.
But instead of implementing the interface,
you create an inner class that extends
the adapter corresponding to the interface.
For example, instead of implementing <code>WindowListener</code>,
you can implement an inner class 
that extends <code>WindowAdapter</code>.
Then you simply create an instance of your inner class
and register it as the appropriate kind of listener --
for example, with the <code>addWindowListener</code> method.
Here is an example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
public class MyClass ... {
    ...
    <em>//Where the window is created:</em>
        <b>newWindow.addWindowListener(new MyInnerClass());</b>
    ...
    <b>class MyInnerClass extends WindowAdapter {
        public void windowClosing(WindowEvent event) {</b>
            if (inAnApplet) {
                dispose();
            } else {
                System.exit(0);
            }
        <b>}
    }</b>
    ...
}

</pre>
</blockquote>

After compilation, the inner class bytecodes
are put in a separate <code>.class</code> file
named something like this:
<code>MyClass$MyInnerClass.class.</code>
For a complete example that uses an inner class, see 
<a href="innerclass/DialogWindow.java"><code>innerclass/DialogWindow.java.</code></a>

<h2>
<a name=example>
Example: Converting DialogWindow
</a>
</h2>

This section shows how to convert a program called DialogWindow
from the 1.0 API to the 1.1 API.
DialogWindow is an application,
but it can also run as an applet,
with the help of a class named <code>AppletButton</code>.
(Readers of
<em><a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html>The
Java Tutorial</a></em>
might find this program familiar,
since it's featured in the section 
<a
href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ui/components/dialog.html>"How
to Use Dialogs"</a>.)

<p>

Below is the 1.0 version of DialogWindow
(here's a link to the <a href=1.0example/DialogWindow.java>source code</a>),
running as an applet with the help of
<a href=1.0example/AppletButton.java>AppletButton</a>:
<p>
<applet codebase=1.0example code=AppletButton.class width=450 height=60>
<param name=windowClass value=DialogWindow>
<param name=windowTitle value="Dialog Demo">
<param name=buttonText value="Click here to get a window that can bring up a dialog">
<param name=windowWidth value=500>
<param name=windowHeight value=130>
<hr>
Since you can't run the applet,
here's a snapshot of the window (<code>Frame</code>) the button brings up:
<p>
<img src=images/DialogWindow-f.gif width=500 height=172>
<p>
And here's a snapshot of the dialog for the window:
<p>
<img src=images/DialogWindow-d.gif width=350 height=125>
<hr>
</applet>

<p>

<h3>
Step 1: Make Copies
</h3>

Move the 1.0 source and bytecode files to a safe place,
keeping a copy of the source file that you can modify.
For example, on a UNIX system:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>mkdir 1.0example</b>
% <b>mv DialogWindow.class 1.0example</b>
% <b>cp DialogWindow.java 1.0example</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Step 2: Convert Automatically
</h3>

Perform as much automatic conversion as possible.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>updateAWT DialogWindow.java &gt; tmp.java</b>
% <b>diff DialogWindow.java tmp.java</b>
33c33
&lt;         dialog.show();
---
&gt;         dialog.setVisible(true);
38c38
&lt;         textArea.appendText(text + "\n");
---
&gt;         textArea.append(text + "\n");
47c47
&lt;         window.show();
---
&gt;         window.setVisible(true);
87c87
&lt;         hide();
---
&gt;         setVisible(false);
% <b>mv tmp.java DialogWindow.java</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Step 3: Compile 
</h3>
Compile DialogWindow,
making sure to use the 1.1 compiler.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>which javac</b>
/usr/local/java/jdk1.1.1/solaris/bin/javac
% <b>javac DialogWindow.java</b>
Note: DialogWindow.java uses a deprecated API.  Recompile with
"-deprecation" for details.
1 warning
%
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>javac -deprecation DialogWindow.java</b>
DialogWindow.java:18: Note: The method boolean handleEvent(java.awt.Event) in
class java.awt.Component has been deprecated, and class DialogWindow overrides
it.
    public boolean handleEvent(Event event) {
                   ^
DialogWindow.java:26: Note: The method boolean handleEvent(java.awt.Event) in
class java.awt.Component has been deprecated.
        return super.handleEvent(event);
                                ^
DialogWindow.java:29: Note: The method boolean action(java.awt.Event,
java.lang.Object) in class java.awt.Component has been deprecated, and class
DialogWindow overrides it.
    public boolean action(Event event, Object arg) {
                   ^
DialogWindow.java:81: Note: The method boolean action(java.awt.Event,
java.lang.Object) in class java.awt.Component has been deprecated, and class
SimpleDialog overrides it.
    public boolean action(Event event, Object arg) {
                   ^
Note: DialogWindow.java uses a deprecated API.  Please consult the
documentation for a better alternative.
5 warnings
%
</pre>
</blockquote>

As you can see,
the class compiles successfully,
but it calls or overrides methods that have been deprecated
(<code>handleEvent</code> and
<code>action</code>).

<p>

<h3>
Step 4: Make Changes by Hand
</h3>

<p>
For the DialogWindow program,
this step consists solely of converting the event-handling code,
as described previously in
<a href=#listener>Making a Component a Listener</a>.
Searching for "Event" in <code>DialogWindow.java</code>
lets you find the event-handling code
in the two classes
(<code>DialogWindow</code> and <code>SimpleDialog</code>)
that comprise the program.

<p>

Here's an overview of event handling in the DialogWindow program:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <code>DialogWindow</code> handles window destroy events
     for itself.
<li> <code>DialogWindow</code> handles action events
     for the components it contains.
     Upon closer inspection, 
     we can see that it contains only one component 
     that can generate action events: a <code>Button</code>.
<li> <code>SimpleDialog</code> handles action events 
     for the components it contains.
     Upon closer inspection, 
     we can see that it contains three components
     that can generate action events:
     two <code>Button</code>s (Cancel and Set)
     and a <code>TextField</code>.
<li> Both <code>DialogWindow</code> and <code>SimpleDialog</code> 
     contain non-event-handling code,
     so you can't eliminate them
     by moving their event-handling code elsewhere.
</ul>

<p>

The current locations of the event-handling code make sense.
Another way that might make sense is
to have <code>DialogWindow</code> handle all events,
since it is the controlling class in this application.
Yet another possibility
is to introduce a non-<code>Component</code> controlling class
that handles all action events.
To convert the DialogWindow program,
we'll keep its event-handling code in the same components as before
but make the components implement listener interfaces. 

<p>

The following example gives the highlights of the event-related code
in the <a href=DialogWindow.java>converted DialogWindow</a> program.
Significant changes are in <b>bold</b>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>import java.awt.event.*;</b>

public class DialogWindow extends Frame 
			  <b>implements WindowListener,
				     ActionListener</b> {
    ...
    public DialogWindow() {
	...
        Button button = new Button("Click to bring up dialog");
	<b>button.addActionListener(this);</b>
	...
	<b>addWindowListener(this);</b>
    }

    <b>public void windowClosed(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowIconified(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowActivated(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowOpened(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowClosing(WindowEvent event) {</b>
        if (inAnApplet) {
            dispose();
        } else {
            System.exit(0);
        }
    }

    <b>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {</b>

Instead of implementing the <code>WindowListener</code> interface,
<code>DialogWindow</code> could simply contain an inner class
that extends <code>WindowAdapter.</code> 
Here are the highlights of 
<a href="innerclass/DialogWindow.java"><code>DialogWindow</code>
implemented with an inner class</a>.
Significant changes from the 1.0 version are in <b>bold</b>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>import java.awt.event.*;</b>

public class DialogWindow extends Frame 
			  <b>implements ActionListener {</b>
    ...
    public DialogWindow() {
	...
        Button button = new Button("Click to bring up dialog");
	<b>button.addActionListener(this);</b>
	...
	<b>addWindowListener(new DWAdapter());</b>
    }

    <b>class DWAdapter extends WindowAdapter {
        public void windowClosing(WindowEvent event) {</b>
            if (inAnApplet) {
                dispose();
            } else {
                System.exit(0);
            }
        }
    <b>}</b>

    <b>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {</b>
        if (dialog == null) {
            dialog = new SimpleDialog(this, "A Simple Dialog");
        }
        dialog.setVisible(true);
    }
    ...
}

<h3>
Step 5: Test
</h3>

Since the DialogWindow program is an application,
we test it by executing it in the Java interpreter.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>java DialogWindow</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

By using the DialogWindow application,
you can see that it handles all events properly.

<hr>

<h2>
<a name=table>
Event Conversion Table
</a>
</h2>

The following table maps 1.0 events
to their 1.1 counterparts.
The first column lists each 1.0 event type,
along with the name of the method (if any)
that's specific to the event.
Where no method is listed,
the event is always handled in the 
<code>handleEvent</code> method.
The second column lists the 1.0 components
that can generate the event type.
The third column lists the listener interface
that helps you handle the 1.1 equivalents of the listed events.
The fourth column lists the methods
in each listener interface.
