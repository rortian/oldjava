<h1> What are the new binary compatibility requirements for Java 1.1 classes?
</h1>
<a name="20264"></a>
In order to binary ensure compatibility between bytecodes output for Java 1.1 
compilers from different vendors, and to ensure proper applicability of 
debuggers and similar tools to those bytecodes, Java makes certain 
requirements on the form of the bytecodes produced.  This section describes 
the requirements, new in Java 1.1, which pertain to the implementation of 
various kinds of inner and nested top-level classes.
<p><a name="18807"></a>
<h2>		 Bytecode names of classes and interfaces
</h2>
<a name="18804"></a>
Instances of the Java Virtual Machines, and Java bytecodes, refer to reference 
types by means of <em>bytecode names</em> which differ in detail from the names used in 
Java source code.  The bytecode name of a package member <var>T</var> is defined as the 
name of the package, with every `<code>.</code>' replaced by `<code>/</code>', followed (if the package 
name is not null) by another `<code>/</code>', and then by the simple name of <var>T</var>.  The 
bytecode name of <var>T</var> also serves as a prefix for the bytecode name of every class 
defined within the body of <var>T</var>.
<p><a name="18692"></a>
The bytecode name of a class <var>C</var> which is a non-<code>private</code> member of another 
class, and which is not contained (directly or indirectly) in any block or 
<code>private</code> class, is defined as the bytecode name of the immediately-enclosing 
class, followed by `<code>$</code>', followed by the simple name of <var>C</var>.
<p><a name="18722"></a>
All other classes are called <em>inaccessible</em>.  No inaccessible class <var>N</var> can ever be 
referenced by the code of any other compilation unit.  Thus, as long as the 
name of <var>N</var> is chosen by the compiler in such as way as not to conflict with any 
other class in the same compilation unit, the name will be globally unique, 
because (as required previously) its prefix is unique to the package member in 
which it occurs.
<p><a name="20637"></a>
For the sake of tools, there are some additional requirements on the naming of 
an inaccessible class <var>N</var>.  Its bytecode name must consist of the bytecode name 
of an enclosing class (the immediately enclosing class, if it is a member), 
followed either by `<code>$</code>' and a positive decimal numeral chosen by the compiler, 
or by `<code>$</code>' and the simple name of <var>N</var>, or else by both (in that order).  Moreover, 
the bytecode name of a block-local <var>N</var> must consist of its enclosing package 
member <var>T</var>, the characters `<code>$1$</code>', and <var>N</var>, if the resulting name would be unique.
<p><a name="18704"></a>
The string produced by the <code>getName</code> method of <code>Class</code> is derived, in all of 
these cases, from the bytecode name, by replacing `<code>/</code>' by `<code>.</code>'.  There is no 
attempt to "clean up" the name to make it resemble Java source code.
<p><a name="18814"></a>
<h2>		 The class attribute <code>InnerClasses
</code></h2>
<a name="18861"></a>
The bytecode output of a Java 1.1 compiler may refer (via <code>CONSTANT_Class</code> 
entries) to bytecode names of classes or interfaces which are not package 
members.  If so, the bytecodes must also contain an class attribute called 
<code>InnerClasses</code> which declares the encoding of those names.  This attribute 
contains an array of records, one for each encoded name: 
<Table Border="0">
<caption></caption>
<tr><td><br><pre>    <a name="18886"></a>InnerClasses_attribute {
    <a name="18891"></a>  u2 attribute_name_index;
    <a name="18892"></a>  u4 attribute_length;
    <a name="18893"></a>  u2 number_of_classes;
    <a name="18912"></a>  {
    <a name="18913"></a>    u2 inner_class_info_index;   // CONSTANT_Class_info index
    <a name="18914"></a>    u2 outer_class_info_index;   // CONSTANT_Class_info index
    <a name="18897"></a>    u2 inner_name_index;         // CONSTANT_Utf8_info index
    <a name="18898"></a>    u2 inner_class_access_flags; // access_flags bitmask
    <a name="18899"></a>  } classes[number_of_classes]
    <a name="18900"></a>}
</pre>

</Table>

<!--
<Table>
<tr><td>
</Table>
-->
<p><a name="18877"></a>
Each array element records a class with an encoded name, its defining scope, 
its simple name, and a bitmask of the originally declared, untransformed 
access flags.  If an inner class is not a member, its <code>outer_class_info_index</code> 
is zero.  If a class is anonymous, its <code>inner_name_index</code> is zero.
<p><a name="18953"></a>
If a class <var>C</var> was declared <code>protected</code>, the <code>public</code> access flag bit is cleared in 
its <code>InnerClasses</code> record, even though it is set in <var>C</var>'s <code>access_flags</code> field.
<p><a name="18998"></a>
If the <code>outer_class_info_index</code> of a record refers to a class <var>E</var> which itself is 
not a package member, then an earlier record of the same <code>InnerClasses</code> 
attribute must describe <var>E</var>.
<p><a name="19009"></a>
If a class has members which are types, it must have an <code>InnerClasses</code> 
attribute, with a record for each of the types.  The rules already given imply 
that a class which is not a package member has an <code>InnerClasses</code> attribute 
which has a record for it and all of its enclosing classes, except the outermost.
<p><a name="19264"></a>
These rules ensure that compilers and debuggers can correctly interpret 
bytecode names without parsing them, and without opening additional files to 
examine inner class definitions.  Compilers are allowed to omit 
<code>InnerClasses</code> records for inaccessible classes, but they are encouraged to 
include records for all classes, especially when the code is being compiled for 
use with a debugger.
<p><a name="19265"></a>
<h2>		 The member attribute <code>Synthetic
</code></h2>
<a name="19266"></a>
As discussed previously, the compiler synthesizes certain hidden fields and 
methods in order to implement the scoping of names.  These fields are 
<code>private</code> unless noted otherwise, or they are at most of package scope.
<p><a name="19128"></a>
Java 1.1 compilers are required, when producing bytecodes, to mark any field 
or member not directly defined in the source code with an attribute named 
<code>Synthetic</code>.  (At present, the length must be zero.)  This will allow other 
compilers to avoid inadvertant source-level references to non-private hidden 
members, and will allow tools to avoid displaying them unnecessarily.
<p><a name="19139"></a>
(A corresponding mechanism for declaring a local variable to be <code>Synthetic</code> 
may also be introduced.)
<p><a name="19114"></a>
Java 1.1 compilers are strongly encouraged, though not required, to use the 
following naming conventions when implementing inner classes.  Compilers 
may not use synthetic names of the forms defined here for any other purposes.
<p><a name="19109"></a>
A synthetic field pointing to the outermost enclosing instance is named 
<code>this$0</code>.  The next-outermost enclosing instance is <code>this$1</code>, and so forth.  (At 
most one such field is necessary in any given inner class.)  A synthetic field 
containing a copy of a constant <var>v</var> is named <code>val$</code><var>v</var>.  These fields are <code>final</code>.
<p><a name="17863"></a>
All these synthetic fields are initialized by constructor parameters, which have 
the same names as the fields they initialize.  If one of the parameters is the 
innermost enclosing instance, it is the first.  All such constructor parameters 
are deemed to be synthetic.  If the compiler determines that the synthetic 
field's value is used only in the code of the constructor, it may omit the field 
itself, and use only the parameter to implement variable references.
<p><a name="19167"></a>
A non-<code>private</code> <code>final</code> synthetic method which grants access to a private 
member or constructor has a name of the form <code>access$</code><var>N</var>, where <var>N</var> is a 
decimal numeral.  The organization of such access protocols is unspecified.
<p><a name="19229"></a>
Debuggers and similar tools which are 1.1 compatible must recognize these 
naming conventions, and organize variable displays and symbol tables 
accordingly.  Note that tools may need to parse these names.  Compilers are 
strongly encouraged to use these conventions, at least by default.
<p><a name="19281"></a>
Implementations of the Java Virtual Machine may verify and require that the 
synthetic members specified here are defined and used properly.  It is 
reasonable to exploit the nature of synthetic members by basing optimization 
techniques on them.
