<h1> Can a nested class be declared <code><b>final</b></code>,  <code><b>private</b></code>, <code><b>protected</b></code>, or <code><b>static</b></code>?
</h1>
<a name="11040"></a>
All the existing access protection and modification modes apply in a regular 
fashion to types which are members of other classes.  Classes and interfaces 
can be declared <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code> within their enclosing classes.
<p><a name="11042"></a>
A class which is local to a block is not a member, and so cannot be <code>public</code>, 
<code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, or <code>static</code>.  It is in effect private to the block, since it 
cannot be used outside its scope.
<p><a name="16859"></a>
Access protection never prevents a class from using any member of another 
class, as long as one encloses the other, or they are enclosed by a third class.
<p><a name="13907"></a>
Any class (if it has a name) can be declared <code>final</code> or <code>abstract</code>, and any 
accessible non-<code>final</code> named class or interface can serve as a supertype.  A 
compiler may also change a class to be <code>final</code> if it can determine that it has no 
subclasses, and that there is no way for subclasses to be added later.  This is 
possible when a <code>private</code> or block-local class has no subclasses in its scope.

<h2>		 Members that can be marked <code><b>static</b></code>
</h2>
<a name="13909"></a>
The <code>static</code> declaration modifier was designed to give programmers a way to 
define <em>class methods</em> and <em>class variables</em> which pertain to a class as a whole, 
rather than any particular instance.  They are "top-level" entities.
<p><a name="19978"></a>
The <code>static</code> keyword may also modify the declaration of a class <var>C</var> within the 
body of a top-level class <var>T</var>.  Its effect is to declare that <var>C</var> is also a top-level class.  
Just as a class method of <var>T</var> has no current instance of <var>T</var> in its body, <var>C</var> also has 
no current instance of <var>T</var>.  Thus, this new usage of <code>static</code> is not arbitrary.
<p><a name="16806"></a>
As opposed to top-level classes (whether nested or not), inner classes cannot 
declare any <code>static</code> members at all.  To create a class variable for an inner 
class, the programmer must place the desired variable in an enclosing class.
<p><a name="16807"></a>
It is helpful at this point to abuse the terminology somewhat, and say, loosely, 
that the <code>static</code> keyword always marks a "top-level" construct (variable, 
method, or class), which is never subject to an enclosing instance.
<p><a name="16848"></a>
This shows why an inner class cannot declare a <code>static</code> member, because the 
entire body of the inner class is in the scope of one or more enclosing instances. 
<p><a name="16851"></a>
While the C language allows block-local <code>static</code> variables, the same effect can 
be obtained in Java, more regularly and maintainably, by defining the desired 
long-lived variable in the scope which corresponds to the required lifetime.
