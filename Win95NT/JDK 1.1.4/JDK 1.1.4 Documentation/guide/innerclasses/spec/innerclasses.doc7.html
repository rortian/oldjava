<h1> How do inner classes affect the organization of the Java Virtual Machine?
</h1>
<a name="11051"></a>
There are no changes to the class file format as processed by the Java Virtual 
Machine, or to the standard class libraries.  The new features are implemented 
by the compiler.  The organization of the resulting bytecodes is specified with 
enough precision that all 1.1-conforming compilers will produce binary 
compatible class files.
<p><a name="11052"></a>
A single file of Java source code can compile to many class files. Although this 
is not a new phenomenon, the power of the inner class notation means that the 
programmer can end up creating a larger number of class files with relatively 
less code.  In addition, adapter classes tend to be very simple, with few 
methods.  This means that a Java program which uses many inner classes will 
compile to many small class files.  Packaging technologies for such classes 
process them reasonably efficiently.  For example, the class file for the example 
class <code>FixedStack.Enumeration</code> occupies about three quarters of a kilobyte, 
of which about 40% is directly required to implement its code.  This ratio is 
likely to improve over time as file formats are tuned.  The memory usage 
patterns in the virtual machine are comparable.

<h2>		 Class name transformations
</h2>
<a name="11055"></a>
Names of nested classes are transformed as necessary by the compiler to avoid 
conflicts with identical names in other scopes. Names are encoded to the 
virtual machine by taking their source form, qualified with dots, and changing 
each dot `<code>.</code>' after a class name into a dollar sign `<code>$</code>'. (Mechanical translators are 
allowed to use dollar signs in Java.)
<p><a name="16948"></a>
When a class name is <code>private</code> or local to a block, it is globally inaccessible.  A 
compiler may opt to code such an inaccessible name by using an accessible 
enclosing class name as a prefix, followed by a `<code>$</code>' separator and a locally 
unique decimal number.  Anonymous classes must be encoded this way.
<p><a name="16985"></a>
So, an inner class <code>pkg.Foo.Bar</code> gets a run-time name of <code>pkg.Foo$Bar</code>, or 
perhaps something like <code>pkg.Foo$23</code>, if Bar is a <code>private</code> member or local 
class.  Implementations must conform to the format of names, even globally 
inaccessible ones, so that debuggers and similar tools can recognize them.
<p><a name="16986"></a>
Any class file which defines or uses a transformed name also contains an 
attribute (as supported by the 1.0 file format) recording the transformation.  
These attributes are ignorable by the virtual machine and by 1.0 compilers.  
The format of this attribute is described in the section on binary compatibility.
<p><a name="17017"></a>
<h2>		 Names of generated variables and methods
</h2>
<a name="11496"></a>
As we have seen previously, if an inner class uses a variable from an enclosing 
scope, the name expression will be transformed, into a reference either to a 
field of an enclosing instance, or to a field of the current instance which 
provides the value of a <code>final</code> local variable.  A reference to an enclosing 
instance, in turn, is transformed into a reference to a field in a more accessible 
current instance.  These techniques require that the compiler synthesize hidden 
fields in inner classes.
<p><a name="17214"></a>
There is one more category of compiler-generated members.  A <code>private</code> 
member <var>m</var> of a class <var>C</var> may be used by another class <var>D</var>, if one class encloses the 
other, or if they are enclosed by a common class.  Since the virtual machine 
does not know about this sort of grouping, the compiler creates a local protocol 
of access methods in <var>C</var> to allow <var>D</var> to read, write, or call the member <var>m</var>.  These 
methods have names of the form <code>access$0</code>, <code>access$1</code>, etc.  They are never 
public.  Access methods are unique in that they may be added to <em>enclosing</em> 
classes, not just inner classes.
<p><a name="17336"></a>
All generated variables and methods are declared in a class file attribute, so 
that the 1.1 compilers can prevent programs from referring to them directly.
<p><a name="17241"></a>
<h2>		 Security implications
</h2>
<a name="17289"></a>
If an inner class <var>C</var> requires access to a <code>private</code> member <var>m</var> of an enclosing 
class <var>T</var>, the inserted access method for <var>m</var> opens up <var>T</var> to illegal access by any 
class <var>K</var> in the same package.  There at present are no known security problems 
with such access methods, since it is difficult to misuse a method with package 
scope.  The compiler can be instructed to emit warnings when it creates access 
methods, to monitor the creation of possible loopholes.
<p><a name="17359"></a>
If a class <var>N</var> is a <code>protected</code> member of another class <var>C</var>, then <var>N</var>'s class file 
defines it as a <code>public</code> class.  A class file attribute correctly records the 
protection mode bits.  This attribute is ignored by the current virtual machine, 
which therefore will allow access to <var>N</var> by any class, and not just to subclasses 
of <var>C</var>.  The compiler, of course, will correctly diagnose such errors, because it 
looks at the attribute. This is not a security hole, since malicious users can 
easily create subclasses of <var>C</var> and so gain access to <var>N</var>, <code>protected</code> or not.
<p><a name="17362"></a>
Likewise, if a class is a <code>private</code> member of another class, its class file defines 
it as having package scope, and an attribute declares the true access protection, 
so that 1.1 compilers can prevent inadvertant access, even within the package.
