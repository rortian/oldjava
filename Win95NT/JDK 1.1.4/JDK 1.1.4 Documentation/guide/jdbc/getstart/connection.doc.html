<h1>2  - Connection</h1>
<a name="1000908"></a>
This overview is excerpted from <em>JDBC<font size=-1><sup>TM</sup></font> Database Access from Java<font size=-1><sup>TM</sup></font>:  A Tutorial 
and Annotated Reference,</em> currently in progress at JavaSoft.  This book, both a tutorial and the definitive reference manual for JDBC, will be published in the spring of 
1997 by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company as part of the Java series.

<h2>2.1	 &nbsp;&nbsp; Overview</h2>
<a name="1001148"></a>
A <code>Connection</code> object represents a connection with a database.  A connection session includes the SQL statements that are executed and the results that are returned 
over that connection.  A single application can have one or more connections with a 
single database, or it can have connections with many different databases.
<p>
<a name="1000950"></a>
<h3>2.1.1	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Opening a Connection</h3>
<a name="1000951"></a>
The standard way to establish a connection with a database is to call the method 
<code>DriverManager.getConnection</code>. This method takes a string containing a URL. The 
<code>DriverManager</code> class, referred to as the JDBC management layer, attempts to locate 
a driver than can connect to the database represented by that URL.    The <code>DriverManager</code> class maintains a list of registered <code>Driver</code> classes, and when the method 
<code>getConnection</code> is called, it checks with each driver in the list until it finds one that 
can connect to the database specified in the URL.  The <code>Driver</code> method <code>connect</code> uses 
this URL to actually establish the connection.  
<p><a name="1000952"></a>
A user can bypass the JDBC management layer and call <code>Driver</code> methods 
directly.  This could be useful in the rare case that two drivers can connect to a 
database and the user wants to explicitly select a particular driver.  Normally, however, it is much easier to just let the <code>DriverManager</code> class handle opening a connection.  
<p>
<a name="1000959"></a>
The following code exemplifies opening a connection to a database located at 
the URL <code>"jdbc:odbc:wombat"</code> with a user ID of <code>"oboy"</code> and <code>"12Java"</code> as the  password :
<p>
<pre><a name="1000960"></a>    String url = "jdbc:odbc:wombat";
<a name="1000961"></a>    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "oboy", "12Java");
</pre>
<a name="1001163"></a>
<h3>2.1.2	 &nbsp; &nbsp; URLs in General Use</h3>
<a name="1001164"></a>
Since URLs often cause some confusion, we will first give a brief explanation of 
URLs in general and then go on to a discussion of JDBC URLs.
<p><a name="1001165"></a>
A URL  (Uniform Resource Locator) gives information for locating a resource on  the 
Internet.  It can be thought of  as an address.  
<p>
<a name="1001166"></a>
The first part of a URL specifies the protocol used to access information, and it is 
always followed by a colon.  Some common protocols are "ftp", which specifies 
"file transfer protocol,"  and "http," which specifies "hypertext transfer protocol."   If the protocol is "file," it indicates that the resource is in a local file system 
rather than on the Internet.  (Underlining in the examples below is used to indicate the 
part being described; it is not part of the URL.)  
<p>
<pre><a name="1001167"></a>    <strong>        ftp:</strong>//javasoft.com/docs/JDK-1_apidocs.zip
<a name="1001168"></a>    <strong>      http:</strong>//java.sun.com/products/jdk/CurrentRelease
<a name="1001169"></a>            <strong>file</strong>:/home/haroldw/docs/books/tutorial/summary.html
</pre><a name="1001170"></a>
The rest of a URL, everything after the first colon, gives information about 
where the data source is located.  If  the protocol is <code>file</code>, the rest of the URL is the 
path to a file.  For the protocols <code>ftp</code> and <code>http</code>, the rest of the URL identifies the 
host and may optionally give a path to a more specific site.  For example, below is 
the URL for the JavaSoft home page.  This URL identifies only the host:
<p>
<pre><a name="1001171"></a>    http://java.sun.com
</pre><a name="1001172"></a>
By navigating from this home page, one can go to many other pages, one of which is 
the JDBC home page.  The URL for the JDBC home page is more specific and 
looks like this:
<p><pre><a name="1001173"></a>    http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc
</pre>
<a name="1001174"></a>
<h3>2.1.3	 &nbsp; &nbsp; JDBC URLs  </h3>
<a name="1001175"></a>
A JDBC URL provides a way of identifying a database so that the appropriate driver 
will recognize it and establish a connection with it.  Driver writers are the ones who 
actually determine what the JDBC URL that identifies their particular driver will be.  
Users do not need to worry about how to form a JDBC URL; they simply use the 
URL supplied with the drivers they are using.  JDBC's role is to recommend some 
conventions for driver writers to follow in structuring their JDBC URLs.
<p><a name="1001176"></a>
Since JDBC URLs are used with various kinds of drivers,  the conventions are  
of necessity very flexible.  First, they allow different drivers to use different 
schemes for naming databases.  The <code>odbc</code> subprotocol, for example, lets the URL 
contain attribute values (but does not require them).   
<p>
<a name="1001177"></a>
Second, JDBC URLs allow  driver writers to encode all necessary connection 
information within them.  This makes it possible, for example, for an applet that 
wants to talk to a given database to open the database connection without requiring the user to do any system administration chores.  
<p>
<a name="1001178"></a>
Third, JDBC URLs allow a level of indirection.  This means that the JDBC 
URL may refer to a logical host or database name that is dynamically translated to 
the actual name by a network naming system.  This allows system administrators 
to avoid specifying particular hosts as part of the JDBC name.  There are a number of different network name services (such as DNS, NIS, and DCE), and there is 
no restriction about which ones can be used.
<p>
<a name="1001179"></a>
 The standard syntax for JDBC URLs is shown below.  It <strong>has three parts, 
which are separated by colons:</strong>
<p>
<pre><a name="1001180"></a>      jdbc:&lt;subprotocol&gt;:&lt;subname&gt;
</pre><a name="1001181"></a>
<strong>The three parts of a JDBC URL are broken down as follows:
</strong><p>
<ol>
<a name="1001182"></a>
<li><code>jdbc</code>-the protocol.  The protocol in a JDBC URL is always <code>jdbc</code>.


<pre><a name="1001183"></a>    
</pre><a name="1001184"></a>
<li> <code>&lt;subprotocol&gt;</code>-the name of the driver or the name of a database connectivity 
mechanism, which may be supported by one or more drivers.  A prominent example of a subprotocol name is "odbc", which has been reserved for URLs that 
specify ODBC-style data source names.  For example, to access a database 
through a JDBC-ODBC bridge, one might use a URL such as the following:

<pre><a name="1001185"></a>      jdbc:odbc:fred
<a name="1001186"></a>
 In this example, the subprotocol is "odbc", and the subname "fred" is a local 
ODBC data source.
<p>
</pre><blockquote><a name="1001187"></a>
If one wants to use a network name service (so that the database name in 
the JDBC URL does not have to be its actual name), the naming service can 
be the subprotocol.  So, for example, one might have a URL like:
<p>
</blockquote><pre><a name="1001188"></a>      jdbc:dcenaming:accounts-payable
<a name="1001189"></a>
 In this example, the URL specifies that the local DCE naming service should 
resolve the database name "accounts-payable" into a more specific name that 
can be used to connect to the real database.
<p>
</pre><blockquote><a name="1001190"></a>

<p>
</blockquote><a name="1001191"></a>
<li><code>&lt;subname&gt;</code>-a way to identify the database.  The subname can vary, depending 
on the subprotocol, and it can have a subsubname with any internal syntax the 
driver writer chooses.  The point of a subname is to give enough information 
to locate the database.  In the previous example, "fred" is enough because 
ODBC provides the remainder of the information.  A database  on a remote 
server requires more information, however.  If the database is to be accessed 
over the Internet, for example, the network address should be included in the 
JDBC URL as  part of the subname and should follow the standard URL naming convention of 

</ol>
<pre><a name="1001192"></a>       <code>//hostname:port/subsubname</code> 
<a name="1001193"></a>
 Supposing that "dbnet" is a protocol for connecting to a host on the Internet, a 
JDBC URL might look like this:
<p>
<a name="1001194"></a>      jdbc:dbnet://wombat:356/fred
</pre>
<a name="1001002"></a>
<h3>2.1.4	 &nbsp; &nbsp; The "odbc" Subprotocol</h3>
<a name="1001003"></a>
The subprotocol <code>odbc</code> is a special case.  It has been reserved for URLs that 
specify ODBC-style data source names and has the special feature of allowing any 
number of  attribute values to be specified after the subname (the data source 
name).  The full syntax for the odbc subprotocol is:
<p>
<a name="1001004"></a>

<p>
<pre><a name="1001005"></a>      jdbc:odbc:&lt;<code>data-source-name</code>&gt;[;&lt;<code>attribute-name&gt;</code>=&lt;<code>attribute-value</code>&gt;]*
</pre><a name="1001006"></a>

<p>
<a name="1001007"></a>
Thus all of the following are valid <code>jdbc:odbc</code> names:
<p>
<pre><a name="1001008"></a>    <code>  jdbc:odbc:qeor7
</code><a name="1001009"></a>    <code>  jdbc:odbc:wombat
</code><a name="1001010"></a>    <code>  jdbc:odbc:wombat;CacheSize=20;ExtensionCase=LOWER
</code><a name="1001011"></a>    <code>  jdbc:odbc:qeora;UID=kgh;PWD=fooey
</code></pre>
<a name="1001012"></a>
<h3>2.1.5	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Registering Subprotocols</h3>
<a name="1001013"></a>
A driver developer can reserve a name to be used as the subprotocol in a JDBC 
URL.   When the <code>DriverManager</code> class presents this name to its list of registered 
drivers, the driver for which this name is reserved should recognize it and establish a 
connection to the database it identifies.  For example, <code>odbc</code> is reserved for the JDBC-
ODBC Bridge.  If there were, for another example, a Miracle Corporation, it might 
want to register "miracle" as the subprotocol for the JDBC driver that connects to its 
Miracle DBMS so that no one else would use that name.  
<p><a name="1001014"></a>
JavaSoft is acting as an informal registry for JDBC subprotocol names.  To 
register a subprotocol name, send email to:
<p>
<pre><a name="1001015"></a>      jdbc@wombat.eng.sun.com
</pre>
<a name="1001016"></a>
<h3>2.1.6	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Sending SQL Statements</h3>
<a name="1001017"></a>
Once a connection is established, it is used to pass SQL statements to its underlying 
database.  JDBC does not put any restrictions on the kinds of SQL statements that 
can be sent; this provides a great deal of flexibility, allowing the use of database-specific statements or even non-SQL statements.  It requires, however,  that  the user be 
responsible for making sure that the underlying database can process the SQL statements being sent and suffer the consequences if it cannot.  For example, an application that tries to send a stored procedure call to a DBMS that does not support stored 
procedures will be unsuccessful and generate an exception.  JDBC requires that a 
driver provide at least ANSI SQL-2 Entry Level capabilities in order to be designated JDBC COMPLIANT<font size=-1><sup>TM</sup></font>.  This means that users can count on at least this standard level of functionality.
<p><a name="1001018"></a>
JDBC provides three classes for sending SQL statements to the database, and 
three methods in the <code>Connection</code> interface create instances of these  classes.  
These classes and the methods which create them are listed below:
<p>
<ol>
<a name="1001019"></a>
<li> <code>Statement</code>- -created by the method <code>createStatement</code>.  A <code>Statement</code> object is 
used for sending simple SQL statements. 


<a name="1001020"></a>
<li><code>PreparedStatement</code>- -created by the method <code>prepareStatement</code>.  A <code>PreparedStatement</code> object is  used for SQL statements that take one or more parameters 
as input arguments (IN parameters).  <code>PreparedStatement</code> has a group of  methods which set the value of IN parameters, which are sent to the database when 
the statement is executed. Instances of <code>PreparedStatement</code> extend <code>Statement</code> 
and therefore include <code>Statement</code> methods.  A <code>PreparedStatement</code> object has 
the potential to be more efficient than a <code>Statement</code> object because it has been 
pre-compiled and stored for future use. 

<a name="1001091"></a>
<li><code>CallableStatement</code>- -created by the method <code>prepareCall</code>.   <code>CallableStatement</code> objects are used to execute SQL stored procedures- -a group of SQL statements that is called by name, much like invoking a function.  A 
<code>CallableStatement</code> object inherits methods for handling IN parameters from 
<code>PreparedStatement</code>; it adds methods for handling OUT and INOUT parameters.

</ol>
<a name="1001022"></a>
The following list gives a quick way to determine which <code>Connection</code> method 
is appropriate for creating different types of SQL statements:
<p>
<a name="1001023"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><a name="1001024"></a>
<code>createStatement</code>  method is used for
<p>


<ul>
<a name="1001025"></a>
<li>simple SQL statements (no parameters)
<br><br>
</ul>
</blockquote><a name="1001026"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><a name="1001027"></a>
<code>prepareStatement</code> method is used for
<p>


<ul>
<a name="1001028"></a>
<li>SQL statements with one or more IN parameters
<br><br>
<a name="1001029"></a>
<li>simple SQL statements  that are executed frequently
<br><br>
</ul>
</blockquote><a name="1001030"></a>

<p>
<blockquote><a name="1001031"></a>
<code>prepareCall</code> method is used for
<p>


<ul>
<a name="1001032"></a>
<li>call to stored procedures
<br><br>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<a name="1001033"></a>
<h3>2.1.7	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Transactions</h3>
<a name="1001034"></a>
A transaction consists of one or more statements that have been executed, completed, and then either committed or rolled back.   When the method <code>commit</code> or 
<code>rollback</code> is called, the current transaction ends and another one begins.  
<p><a name="1001035"></a>
A new connection is in auto-commit mode by default, meaning that when a 
statement is completed, the method <code>commit</code> will be called on that statement automatically.  In this case, since each statement is committed individually, a transaction consists of only one statement.  If auto-commit mode has been disabled, a 
transaction will not terminate until the method <code>commit</code> or <code>rollback</code> is called 
explicitly, so it will include all the statements that have been executed since the 
last invocation of  the <code>commit</code> or <code>rollback</code> method.  In this second case, all the 
statements in the transaction are committed or rolled back as a group.
<p>
<a name="1001036"></a>
The method <code>commit</code> makes permanent any changes an SQL statement makes  
to a database, and it also releases any locks held by the transaction.  The method 
<code>rollback</code> will discard those changes.
<p>
<a name="1001037"></a>
  Sometimes a user doesn't want one change to take effect unless another one 
does also.  This can be accomplished by disabling auto-commit and grouping both 
updates into one transaction.  If both updates are successful, then the <code>commit</code> 
method is called, making the effects of both updates permanent; if one fails or 
both fail, then the <code>rollback</code> method  is called, restoring the values that existed 
before the updates were executed.  
<p>
<a name="1001038"></a>
Most JDBC drivers will support transactions.  In fact, a JDBC-compliant 
driver must support transactions.  <code>DatabaseMetaData</code> supplies information 
describing the level of transaction support  a DBMS provides. 
<p>

<a name="1001039"></a>
<h3>2.1.8	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Transaction Isolation Levels</h3>
<a name="1001040"></a>
If a DBMS supports transaction processing, it will have some way of managing 
potential conflicts that can arise when two transactions are operating on a database 
at the same time.  A user can specify a transaction isolation level to indicate what 
level of care the DBMS should exercise in resolving potential conflicts.  For example, what happens when one transaction changes a value and a second transaction 
reads that value before the change has been committed or rolled back?    Should that 
be allowed, given that the changed value read by the second transaction will be 
invalid if the first transaction is rolled back?  A JDBC user can instruct the DBMS to 
allow  a value to be read before it has been committed ("dirty reads") with the following code, where <code>con</code> is the current connection:
<p><pre><a name="1001041"></a>    con.setTransactionIsolation(TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED);
</pre><a name="1001042"></a>
The higher the transaction isolation level, the more care is taken to avoid conflicts.  The <code>Connection</code> interface defines five levels, with  the lowest specifying 
that transactions are not supported at all and the highest specifying that while one 
transaction is operating on a database, no other transactions may make any 
changes to the data read by that transaction.  Typically, the higher the level of isolation, the slower the application executes (due to increased locking overhead and 
decreased concurrency between users).   The developer must balance the need for 
performance with the need for data consistency when making a decision about 
what isolation level to use.  Of course, the level that can actually be supported 
depends on the capabilities of the underlying DBMS.
<p>
<a name="1001043"></a>
When a new <code>Connection</code> object is created, its transaction isolation level 
depends on the driver, but normally it is the default for the underlying database.  A 
user  may call the method <code>setIsolationLevel</code> to  change the transaction isolation 
level, and the new level will be in effect for the rest of the connection session.  To 
change the transaction isolation level for just one transaction, one needs to set it 
before the transaction begins and reset it after the transaction terminates. Changing the transaction isolation level during a transaction is not recommended, for it 
will trigger an immediate call to the method <code>commit</code>, causing any changes up to 
that point to be made permanent.
