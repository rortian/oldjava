<h1>10  - JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver </h1>

<a name="997135"></a>
<h2>10.1	 &nbsp;&nbsp; JDBC-ODBC Bridge</h2>
<a name="996910"></a>
 If possible, use a Pure Java JDBC driver instead of the Bridge and an ODBC driver. 
This completely eliminates the client configuration required by ODBC. It also eliminates the potential that the Java VM could be corrupted by an error in the native 
code brought in by the Bridge (that is, the Bridge native library, the ODBC driver 
manager library, the ODBC driver library, and the database client library). 
<p>
<a name="996913"></a>
<h3>10.1.1	 &nbsp; &nbsp; What Is the JDBC-ODBC Bridge?  </h3>
<a name="997016"></a>
The JDBC-ODBC Bridge is a JDBC driver which implements JDBC operations by 
translating them into ODBC operations. To ODBC it appears as a normal application program. The Bridge implements JDBC for any database for which an ODBC 
driver is available. The Bridge is implemented as the <code>sun.jdbc.odbc</code> Java package 
and contains a native library used to access ODBC. The Bridge is a joint development of Intersolv and JavaSoft. 
<p>
<a name="996914"></a>
<h3>10.1.2	 &nbsp; &nbsp; What Version of ODBC Is Supported?</h3>
<a name="997019"></a>
The bridge supports ODBC 2.x. This is the version that most ODBC drivers currently support. It will also likely work with most forthcoming ODBC 3.x drivers; 
however, this has not been tested. 
<p>
<a name="996915"></a>
<h3>10.1.3	 &nbsp; &nbsp; The Bridge Implementation</h3>
<a name="997026"></a>
The Bridge is implemented in Java and uses Java native methods to call ODBC. 
<p>
<a name="996916"></a>
<h3>10.1.4	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Installation</h3>
<a name="997033"></a>
The Bridge is installed automatically with the JDK as package <code>sun.jdbc.odbc</code>.  See 
your ODBC driver vendor for information on installing and configuring ODBC. No 
special configuration is required for the Bridge. See your database vendor for client 
installation and configuration information. On Solaris, some ODBC driver managers name their libs <code>libodbcinst.so</code> and <code>libodbc.so</code>. The Bridge expects these 
libraries to be named <code>libodbcinst.so.1</code> and <code>libodbc.so.1</code>, so symbolic links for 
these names must be created. 
<p>
<a name="996917"></a>
<h2>10.2	 &nbsp;&nbsp; Using the Bridge </h2>
<a name="997040"></a>
The Bridge is used by opening a JDBC connection using a URL with the <code>odbc</code> subprotocol. See below for URL examples. Before a connection can be established, the 
bridge driver class, <code>sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver</code>, must either be added to the 
<code>java.lang.System</code> property named <code>jdbc.drivers</code>, or it must be explicitly loaded 
using the Java class loader.  Explicit loading is done with the following line of code:     
<p><pre><a name="996978"></a>    Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver"); 
</pre><a name="996979"></a>
When loaded, the ODBC driver (like all good JDBC drivers) creates an 
instance of itself and registers this with the JDBC driver manager. 
<p>

<a name="996918"></a>
<h3>10.2.1	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Using the Bridge from an Applet</h3>
<a name="997093"></a>
JDBC used with a Pure Java JDBC driver works well with applets. The Bridge 
driver does not work well with applets. 
<p>
<a name="996919"></a>
<h3>10.2.2	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Most Browsers Do Not Support the Bridge</h3>
<a name="997100"></a>
Since the Bridge is an optional component of the JDK, it may not be provided by a 
browser. Even if it is provided, only trusted applets (those allowed to write to files) 
will be able to use the Bridge. This is required in order to preserve the security of the 
applet sandbox. Finally, even if the applet is trusted, ODBC and the DBMS client 
library must be configured on each client. 
<p>
<a name="996920"></a>
<h3>10.2.3	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Tested Configurations </h3>
<a name="997107"></a>
From Solaris, we have used the Bridge to access Oracle 7.1.6 and Sybase Version 10 
running on Solaris. From NT, we have used the Bridge to access SQL Server 6.x. 
<p>
<a name="996921"></a>
<h3>10.2.4	 &nbsp; &nbsp; ODBC Drivers Known to Work with the Bridge</h3>
<a name="997114"></a>
Visigenic provides ODBC drivers which have been tested with the the Bridge. Drivers are available for Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server, and Ingres. To 
purchase the ODBC DriverSet 2.0, please contact Visigenic sales at 415-312-7197, 
or visit the web site <code>www.visigenic.com</code>. The INTERSOLV ODBC driver suite 
should be completely compatible with the JDBC-ODBC Bridge. The following 
drivers have successfully passed a minimal test suite: Oracle, xBASE, Sybase (Windows NT/95 only), Microsoft SQL-Server, and Informix. To evaluate or purchase 
INTERSOLV ODBC drivers, please contact INTERSOLV DataDirect Sales at 1- 
800-547-4000 Option 2 or via the World Wide Web at <code>http:\\www.intersolv.com</code>. 
The MS SQL Server driver has also been used successfully on NT. Many other 
ODBC drivers will likely work. 
<p>
<a name="996922"></a>
<h3>10.2.5	 &nbsp; &nbsp; ODBC Driver Incompatibilities</h3>
<a name="997062"></a>
On Solaris, we have found that the Sybase ctlib-based drivers don't work because 
ctlib has a signal-handling conflict with the Java VM. This is likely not a problem on 
NT due to differences in the NT Java VM; however, this has not been verified. Some 
ODBC drivers only allow a single result set to be active per connection. 
<p>
<a name="996923"></a>
<h3>10.2.6	 &nbsp; &nbsp; What Is the JDBC URL Supported by the Bridge? </h3>
<a name="997123"></a>
The Bridge driver uses the <code>odbc</code> subprotocol. URLs for this subprotocol are of the 
form: 
<p><pre><a name="997124"></a>    <code>jdbc:odbc:&lt;data-source-name&gt;[&lt;attribute-name&gt;=&lt;attribute-value&gt;]*
</code></pre><a name="997125"></a>
For example: 
<p>
<pre><a name="997006"></a>    jdbc:odbc:sybase
<a name="997007"></a>    jdbc:odbc:mydb;UID=me;PWD=secret
<a name="997013"></a>    jdbc:odbc:ora123;Cachesize=300
</pre>
<a name="996924"></a>
<h3>10.2.7	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Debugging</h3>
<a name="997077"></a>
The Bridge provides extensive tracing when <code>DriverManager</code> tracing is enabled. The 
following line of code enables tracing and sends it to standard out:    
<p><pre><a name="997072"></a>     java.sql.DriverManager.setLogStream(java.lang.System.out);
</pre>
<a name="996927"></a>
<h2>10.3	 &nbsp;&nbsp; General Notes</h2>
<a name="997086"></a>
The Bridge assumes that ODBC drivers are not reentrant. This means the Bridge 
must synchronize access to these drivers. The result is that the Bridge provides limited concurrency. This is a limitation of the Bridge. Most Pure Java JDBC drivers 
provide the expected level of concurrent access.
