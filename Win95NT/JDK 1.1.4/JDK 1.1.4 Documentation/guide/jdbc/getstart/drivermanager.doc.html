<h1>3  - DriverManager</h1>

This overview is excerpted from <em>JDBC<font size=-1><sup>TM</sup></font> Database Access from Java<font size=-1><sup>TM</sup></font>:  A Tutorial 
and Annotated Reference,</em> currently in progress at JavaSoft.  This book, both a tutorial and the definitive reference manual for JDBC, will be published in the spring of 
1997 by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company as part of the Java series.

<h2>3.1	 &nbsp;&nbsp; Overview</h2>
<a name="999086"></a>
The <code>DriverManager</code> class is the management layer of JDBC, working between 
the user and the drivers. It keeps track of the drivers that are available and handles 
establishing a connection between a database and the appropriate driver. In addition, 
the <code>DriverManager</code> class attends to things like driver login time limits and the printing of log and tracing messages.  
<p><a name="999049"></a>
For simple applications, the only method in this class that a general programmer needs to use directly is <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code>.  As its name implies, 
this method establishes a connection to a database.   JDBC allows the user to call 
the <code>DriverManager</code> methods <code>getDriver</code>, <code>getDrivers</code>, and <code>registerDriver</code> as well 
as the <code>Driver</code> method <code>connect</code>, but in most cases it is better to let the <code>DriverManager</code> class manage the details of establishing a connection.
<p>

<h3>3.1.1	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Keeping Track of Available Drivers</h3>
<a name="999103"></a>
The <code>DriverManager</code> class maintains a list of <code>Driver</code> classes that have registered 
themselves by calling the method <code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code>.  All <code>Driver</code> 
classes should be written with a static section that creates an instance of the class 
and then registers it with the <code>DriverManager</code> class when it is loaded. Thus, a user 
would not normally call <code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code> directly; it should be 
called automatically by a driver when it is loaded.  A <code>Driver</code> class is loaded, and 
therefore automatically registered with the <code>DriverManager</code>, in two ways:
<p><ol>
<a name="999052"></a>
<li>By calling the method <code>Class.forName</code>.   This explicitly loads the driver class.  
Since it does not depend on any external setup, this way of loading a driver is 
recommended. The following code loads the class <code>acme.db.Driver</code>:


<pre><a name="999053"></a>    Class.forName("acme.db.Driver");
</pre><a name="999054"></a>
If  <code>acme.db.Driver</code> has been written so that loading it causes an instance to be 
created and also calls <code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code> with that instance as 
the parameter (as it should do), then it is in the <code>DriverManager</code>'s list of drivers 
and available for creating a connection.
<p>
<a name="999056"></a>
<li>By adding the driver to the <code>java.lang.System</code> property <code>jdbc.drivers</code>.  This is 
a list of driver classnames, separated by colons, that the <code>DriverManager</code> class 
loads.   When the <code>DriverManager</code> class is intialized, it looks for the system 
property <code>jdbc.drivers</code>, and if the user has entered one or more drivers, the 
<code>DriverManager</code> class attempts to load them.  The following code illustrates 
how a programmer might enter three driver classes in  <code>~/.hotjava/properties</code> 
(HotJava loads these into the system properties list on startup):

</ol>
<pre><a name="999057"></a>    jdbc.drivers=foo.bah.Driver:wombat.sql.Driver:bad.test.ourDriver;
</pre><a name="999058"></a>
The first call to a <code>DriverManager</code> method will automatically cause these driver 
classes to be loaded. 
<p>
<a name="999059"></a>
Note that this second way of loading drivers requires a preset environment 
that is persistent.  If there is any doubt about that being the case, it is safer to call 
the method <code>Class.forName</code> to explicitly load each driver.  This is also the method 
to use to bring in a particular driver since once the <code>DriverManager</code> class has been 
initialized, it will never recheck the <code>jdbc.drivers</code> property list.
<p>
<a name="999060"></a>
     In both of the cases listed above, it is the responsibility of the newly-loaded 
<code>Driver</code> class to register itself by calling <code>DriverManager.registerDriver</code>.  As 
mentioned above, this should be done automatically when the class is loaded.
<p>
<a name="999061"></a>
For security reasons, the JDBC management layer will keep track of which 
class loader provided which driver. Then when the <code>DriverManager</code> class is opening a connection, it will use only drivers that come from the local file system or 
from the same class loader as the code issuing the request for a connection.
<p>

<h3>3.1.2	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Establishing a Connection</h3>
<a name="999106"></a>
Once the <code>Driver</code> classes have been loaded and registered with the <code>DriverManager</code> 
class, they are available for establishing a connection with a database. When a 
request for a connection is made with a call to the <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code> 
method, the <code>DriverManager</code> tests each driver in turn to see if it can establish a connection.  
<p><a name="999064"></a>
It may sometimes be the case that more than one JDBC driver is capable of 
connecting to a given URL.  For example, when connecting to a given remote 
database, it might be possible to use a JDBC-ODBC bridge driver, a JDBC-to-
generic-network-protocol driver, or a driver supplied by the database vendor.  In 
such cases, the order in which the drivers are tested is significant because the 
<code>DriverManager</code> will use the first driver it finds that can successfully connect to the 
given URL.
<p>
<a name="999065"></a>
First the <code>DriverManager</code> tries to use each of the drivers in the order they were 
registered.  (The drivers listed in <code>jdbc.drivers</code> are always registered first.)  It will 
skip any drivers which are untrusted code, unless they have been loaded from the 
same source as the code that is trying to open the connection.
<p>
<a name="999066"></a>
It tests the drivers by calling the method <code>Driver.connect</code> on each one in turn, 
passing them the URL that the user originally passed to the method <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code>.  The first driver that recognizes the URL  makes the connection.  
<p>
<a name="999067"></a>
At first glance this may seem inefficient, but it requires only a few procedure 
calls and string comparisons per connection since it is unlikely that dozens of 
drivers will be loaded concurrently. 
<p>
<a name="999068"></a>
The following code is an example of all that is normally needed to set up a 
connection with a driver such as a JDBC-ODBC bridge driver:
<p>
<pre><a name="999069"></a>    Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");  //loads the driver
<a name="999070"></a>    String url = "jdbc:odbc:fred";
<a name="999071"></a>    DriverManager.getConnection(url, "userID", "passwd");
<a name="998237"></a>    
</pre>
