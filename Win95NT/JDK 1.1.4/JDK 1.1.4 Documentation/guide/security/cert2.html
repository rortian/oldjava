Why should I care about X.509 certificates?
</H2>

<P>
You may already be hearing about X.509 certificates.
If you have, this document can explain to you what
they do for you.  If you haven't heard people talking
about X.509 certificates, you may want to read this
document to learn more about the Internet security
tools they facilitate.  There are several parts to this
document: <UL>

<LI>In One Sentence:  What's a Certificate?
<LI>What Applications use Certificates?
<LI>How do I get a Certificate?
<LI>What's Inside an X.509 Certificate?
<LI>What Java Tool Can Generate, Display, Import, and Export X.509 Certificates?

<H2>In One Sentence:  What's a Certificate? </H2>

<P>An <EM>identity certificate</EM> is a digitally signed statement from
one entity, saying that the public key of some
other entity has some particular value. 

<P>In case you don't understand that sentence, here are
a few definitions: <UL>

<LI><em>Public Keys</em> are numbers associated with a
particular entity, and are intended to be known to everyone
who needs to have trusted interactions with that entity.<p>

<LI>An <em>entity</em> is a person, organization, program,
computer, business, bank,
or something else you're trusting to some degree.<p>

<LI>If some data is <em>digitally signed</em> it has been
stored with the name of an entity, and a signature
that proves that entity knows about the data.<p>

<LI>A <em>signature</em> is computed from some data and
the private key of an entity.<p>

<LI><em>Private Keys</em> are numbers that are
supposed to be known only to a particular entity (i.e., kept secret).  A private 
key is always associated with a single public key.

</UL>

<P>
Certificates rely on public key encryption technologies.
To understand certificates, you don't need to know much
beyond the facts that
<em>(a)</em> private and public keys are paired,
<em>(b)</em> private keys are used to sign, and
<em>(c)</em> public keys are used to verify signatures.

<P>
One other term that comes up a lot is
<em>Certification Authority</em> (CA).
These are entities (e.g., businesses) that are trusted
to sign (issue) certificates for other people (entities).  They
usually have some kind of legal responsibilities for
their vouching for the binding between a public key and
its owner. There are many such Certification Authorities, such as
VeriSign, GTE, and so on.

<!-- *********************************************************** -->
<HR>
<H2>What Applications use Certificates? </H2>

<P>
Probably the most widely visible application of X.509 certificates
today is in web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator) that support
the SSL protocol.  SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a security protocol
that provides
privacy and authentication for your network traffic.  These
browsers can only use this protocol with web servers that support it.

<P>
Other technologies that rely on X.509 certificates include:
<UL>
<LI>Various secure E-Mail standards, such as PEM and S/MIME.
<LI>E-Commerce protocols such as SET.
<LI>Various code-signing schemes, such as Microsoft AuthentiCode
and signed Java ARchives (JAR files).
</UL>

<H2>How do I Get a Certificate? </H2>

<P>
There are two basic techniques used to get certificates:
<em>(1)</em>
you can make one yourself (using the right tools), or
<em>(2)</em>
you can ask someone else (a CA) to issue you one.
The main inputs to the certificate creation process are:  <UL>

<LI>
Matched <em>public and private keys</em>, generated using some
special tools (such as <a href = "#javakey">javakey</a>).  
<strong>Only the public key
is ever shown to anyone else.</strong>
The private key is used to sign data; if someone knows your
private key, they can masquerade as you ... perhaps forging legal
documents attributed to you!<p>

<LI>
You need to provide <em>information about the entity
being certified</em> (e.g., you).  This normally includes
information such as your name and organizational address.
If you ask a CA to issue a certificate for you, you will
normally need to provide proof to show correctness of the information.

</UL>

<P>
If you're asking a CA to issue you a certificate, you
provide your public key and some information about
you.  You'll use a tool (such as Netscape Navigator 3.0)
to digitally sign this information, and send it to the
CA.  (That CA might be a company like Verisign 
that provides <em>trusted third-party</em> CA services.  It might be your
Internet Service Provider, or some other organization.)
The CA will then generate the certificate and return it.

<P>
If you're generating the certificate yourself, you'll
take that same information, add a little more (dates
during which the certificate is valid, a serial number), and
just create the certificate using some tool (such as <a href = 
"#javakey">javakey</a>).
Not everyone will accept self-signed certificates; one
part of the value provided by a CA is to serve as a
neutral and trusted  introduction service, based in part on their
verification requirements, which are openly published in their
Certification Service Practices (CSP).

<H2>What's Inside an X.509 Certificate? </H2>

<P>
X.509 defines what information can go into a certificate,
and describes how to write it down (the data format).
All X.509 certificates have the following data, in addition
to the signature:

<OL>
<LI><em>Version</em>
<br>This identifies which version of the X.509 standard applies to
    this certificate, which affects what information can be specified
    in it.
    Version 1 has been available since 1988, and is widely deployed.<p>

<LI><em>Subject Name</em>
<br>The name of the entity whose public key the certificate identifies.
    This name uses the X.500 standard, so it is intended to be
    unique across the Internet. This is the Distinguished Name (DN) of
    the entity, for example,
<pre>
    CN=Java Duke, OU=JavaSoft, O=Sun Microsystems Inc, C=US
</pre>

(These refer to the subject's common name, organizational unit, 
organization, and country)<p>

<LI><em>Public Key</em>
<br>This is the public key of the entity being named.<p>

<LI><em>Issuer Name</em>
<br>The X.500 name of the entity that signed the certificate.  This 
    is normally a CA.  Using this certificate implies trusting the
    entity that signed this certificate.  (Note that in some cases,
    such as <em>root or top-level</em> CA certificates, the issuer
signs its own certificate.)<p>

<LI><em>Serial Number</em>
<br>The entity that created the certificate is responsible for
    assigning it a serial number to distinguish it from other
    certificates it generates.<p>

<LI><em>Validity Period</em>
<br>Each certificate is valid only for a limited amount of time.  This
    period is described by a start date and time and an end date and time, 
    and can be as short as a few seconds or almost as long as a century.
    The validity period depends on a number of factors, such as the
strength of the private key used to sign the certificate or the amount
one is willing to pay for a certificate.
</OL>

<P>
Those base features are part of <em>X.509 v1</em>,
the first version.
<em>X.509 v2</em> added features including
certificate revocation lists (CRLs) used by CAs to say
that particular certificates should no longer be trusted.
<em>X.509 v3</em> (in 1996) added the notion of extensions,
of which <em>keyUsage</em> (limits the use of the keys for
particular purposes such as "signing-only") and <em>AltNames</em>
(allows other Names, e.g. DNS names, Email addresses, IP addresses)
are very popular.

<P>
All the data in a certificate is encoded using two related
standards called ASN.1/DER.
<em>Abstract Syntax Notation 1</em> describes data.
The <em>Definite Encoding Rules</em> describe a single
way to store and transfer that data.
People have been known to describe this combination
simultaneously as "powerful and flexible" and
as "cryptic and awkward".
There seems to be no groundswell of opinion suggesting that
something other than ASN.1/DER be used; the existing
infrastructure works, and can be readily evolved.

<H2><a name="javakey">What Java Tool Can Generate, Display, Import, and Export X.509 Certificates?</a></H2>

There is a new JDK 1.1 tool named <b>javakey</b> 
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/javakey.html">for
Solaris</a>) (<a href="../../tooldocs/win32/javakey.html">for Windows</a>) 
for 

<ul>

  <li>managing a database of entities (people, companies, etc.), their 
public and private keys and certificates, and an indication as to which
entities are "trusted".<p>

  <li>generating digital signatures for Java ARchive (JAR) files, 
which contain arbitrary data, including class files, images, sounds, etc. 

</ul>

<p>Using <b>javakey</b>, it is possible to display, import, and export
certificates stored as files, and to generate new certificates.
