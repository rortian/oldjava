<h1>Java Security API Overview</h1> <br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Java Security API is a new Java core API, built around the
<code>java.security</code> package (and its subpackages).  This first
release includes primarily cryptography functionality, which can be
incorporated into Java-based applications.  Future releases of this
API will include more primitives supporting system security and secure
distributed computing.

<p>The cryptography framework in the Java Security API is designed so
that a new algorithm can be added later on without much difficulty and
can be utilized in the same fashion as existing algorithms.  For
example, although DSA is the only built-in digital signature algorithm
in this release, the framework can easily accommodate another
algorithm such as RSA.

<p>APIs for data encryption and other functionality, together with
their implementations, will be released separately in a "Java
Cryptography Extension" (JCE) as an add-on package to JDK, in
accordance with U.S. export control regulations. Those APIs include
block and stream cipher, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and
support for multiple modes of operation and multiple encryption.

<p> The first release of Java Security, available in JDK 1.1, contains
APIs for:

<dl>

<dt><b>Digital Signatures</b> 

<dd>Digital signature algorithms, such as DSA. The functionality
includes generating public/private key pairs as well as signing and
verifying arbitrary digital data.

<p><dt><b>Message Digests</b>

<dd>Cryptographically secure message digests, such as MD5 and
SHA-1. These algorithms, also called one-way hash algorithms, are
useful for producing "digital fingerprints" of data, which are
frequently used in digital signatures and other applications that need
unique and unforgeable identifiers for digital data.

<p><dt><b>Key Management</b>

<dd>A set of abstractions for managing principals (entities such as
individual users or groups), their keys, and their certificates. It
allows applications to design their own key management systems, and to
interoperate with other systems at a high level. Note that support for
specific certificate formats such as X.509 v3 is not available but
will be part of a future JDK release.

<p><dt><b>Access Control Lists</b>

<dd>A set of abstractions for managing principals and their access
permissions.  A <a href="Acl.html">high-level overview</a> is
available. This API is not used internally for JDK system
security. Also, it will undergo substantial revision and extension in
the next release to provide full access control support.

<h2>Architecture and Design</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Java Security API was designed around these principles:

<UL>
<LI>implementation independence and interoperability<p>
<LI>algorithm independence and extensibility
</UL>

<P>
Implementation independence and algorithm independence are
complementary: their aim is to let users of the API utilize
cryptographic<I> concepts</I>, such as digital signatures and message
digests, without concern for the implementations or even the
algorithms being used to implement these concepts. When complete
algorithm-independence is not possible, developers are provided with
standardized algorithm-specific APIs. When implementation-independence
is not desirable, developers can indicate the specific implementations
they require.

<P>
Implementation independence is achieved using a "provider"-based
architecture. A <a href = "#Providers">Cryptography Package Provider</a>
("provider" for short) is a package or set of packages that implement 
specific algorithms, such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) or the
RSA Cryptosystem (RSA). Applications may
simply request a particular type of object, such as a DSA object, and
get an implementation from an installed provider.  If desired, an
application may instead request an implementation from a specific
provider.

<P>
Algorithm independence is achieved by defining types of cryptographic
"engines" (algorithms), and defining classes that provide the
functionality of these cryptographic engines.  These classes are
referred to as <I>engine classes</I>, and examples include the
MessageDigest and Signature classes.

<P>
Implementation interoperability means that various implementations
can work with each other, use each other's keys, or verify each
other's signatures. This would mean, for example, that for the
same algorithms, a key generated by one provider would be
usable by another, and a signature generated
by one provider would be verifiable by another.

<P>
Algorithm extensibility means that new algorithms that fit in one of
the supported engine classes can be added easily.

<h2><a name="Providers">Cryptography Package Providers</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Java Security is essentially an <i>abstract</i> layer, and
introduces the notion of a <em>Cryptography Package Provider</em> 
("provider" for short). This term refers to
a package (or a set of packages) providing
a concrete implementation of a subset of the cryptography aspects of
the Java Security API.  Java users and clients may install specific
provider packages according to their taste and preference.

<p>JDK 1.1 comes standard with a default provider, named
"SUN".

<p>Each JDK installation has one or more provider packages installed. 
New providers may be added either statically or dynamically:

<ul>

<li>Statically: An authorized administrator or user can add a 
provider to the persistent list of providers that are available to
all programs.<p>

<li>Dynamically: An authorized program can add 
a provider at runtime for its private temporary use. 

</ul>

Users can call methods to query which providers are installed.

<P>
Providers are packages that implement specific
algorithms, such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), or the
RSA Cryptosystem (RSA).
Applications may simply request a particular type of object, such as
a DSA object, and get an implementation
from one of the installed providers.  If desired, a client may instead 
request an implementation from a specific provider.

<P>
When clients configure their system with different providers,
they specify a <i>preference order</i> for each. The preference
order is the order in which providers are searched for requested 
algorithms when no specific provider is requested. 

<p>Clients that wish to obtain and utilize algorithm implementations
do so by calling Java Security API (<code>java.security</code>) 
methods. They never need to (and in fact should not) directly invoke 
provider code.



<h3><a name = "SunSecurity">The "SUN" Provider</a></h3>

<p>In JDK 1.1, there is one default provider, called "SUN". 
The "SUN" provider package includes:

<ul>

<li>An implementation of the Digital Signature Algorithm (NIST FIPS 186).<p>

<li>An implementation of the MD5 (RFC 1321) and SHA-1 (NIST FIPS 180-1)
message digest algorithms.<p>

</ul>

In the default environment that comes with the JDK, whenever any of
these types of algorithms are requested, implementations from the "SUN"
provider will be utilized if "SUN" is the requested service provider
or if no service provider is explicitly specified. In other words, "SUN"
is the highest-priority (default) provider that provides the default
implementation. This preference order is configurable.

<p>The "SUN" provider also supplies a simple system key and trust
management mechanism, including a persistent database of principals,
keys, and X.509 v1 certificates.  The javakey tool interfaces with
this persistent database.
