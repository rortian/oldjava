<H2>What is JAR?</H2>
<P>
JAR stands for Java ARchive.  It's a file format based on the popular ZIP
file format and is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR
can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its
development was so that Java applets and their requisite components (.class
files, images and sounds) can be downloaded to a browser in a single HTTP
transaction, rather than opening a new connection for each piece.  This
greatly improves the speed with which an applet can be loaded onto a web page
and begin functioning. The JAR format also supports compression, which reduces
the size of the file and improves download time still further.  
<!-- REMIND: put a link to download benchmark statistics in here --> 
Additionally, individual entries in a JAR file may be digitally signed by the 
applet author to authenticate their origin.  
<P>
JAR is:
<UL>
  <LI> the only archive format that is cross-platform
  <LI> the only format that handles audio and image files as well as class files
  <LI> backward-compatible with existing applet code
  <LI> an open standard, fully extendable, and written in java
  <LI> the preferred way to bundle the pieces of a java applet  
</UL>

<p>JAR consists of a zip archive, as defined by PKWARE, containing a manifest file and potentially 
signature files, as defined in the <A HREF="manifest.html">Manifest and Signature</A> specification.
<P>
<H2>The APPLET tag</H2>
Changing the APPLET tag in your HTML page to accomodate a JAR file is simple.
The JAR file on the server is identified by the <B>ARCHIVE</B> parameter, where
the directory location of the jar file should be relative to the location of the
html page:
<PRE>
    &ltapplet code=Animator.class 
      archive="jars/animator.jar"
      width=460 height=160>
      &ltparam name=foo value="bar"&gt
    &lt/applet&gt
</PRE>
Note that the familiar <B>CODE=myApplet.class</B> parameter must still be present.  
The <B>CODE</B> parameter, as always, identifies the name of the applet where execution 
begins.  However, the class file for the applet and all of its helper classes are loaded 
from the JAR file.  
<P>
Once the archive file is identified, it is downloaded and separated into its components.
During the execution of the applet, when a new class, image or audio clip is requested by 
the applet, it is searched for first in the archives associated with the applet.  If the file 
is not found amongst the archives that were downloaded, it is searched for on the applet's 
server, relative to the CODEBASE (that is, it is searched for as in JDK1.0.2).
<P>
The archive tag may specify multiple JAR files.  Each JAR file must be
separated by "," (comma).  Each file is downloaded in turn:
<PRE>
    &ltapplet code=Animator.class 
      archive="classes.jar ,  images.jar ,  sounds.jar"
      width=460 height=160>
      &ltparam name=foo value="bar"&gt
    &lt/applet&gt
</PRE>
There can be any amount of white space between entries within the archive parameter.  
In addition, the archive tag itself is case-insensitive; it can be lower-case, 
upper-case, or any combination of lower- and upper-case letters, such as ArCHiVe.
