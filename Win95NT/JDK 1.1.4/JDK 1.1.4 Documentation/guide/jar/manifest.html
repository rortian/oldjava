<h1> Manifest Format </h1>
<p>
<h2> 0. Archive signing </h2>

<p>This specification does not specify the format of the archive file.
Any format supporting hierarchical paths is acceptable. Files added to
the archive for this specification will be kept in a directory as ordinary
files in the archive.

<p>Any URL identifiers in a manifest file will conform to the URL
syntax described in RFC 1738, "Uniform Resource Locators." 
Additionally, hierarchical paths in a manifest will use '/' 
(forward-slash) as the separator, for consistency with the URL syntax
of RFC 1738."

<p><h2>1. Reasons for this scheme. </h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li> No modification to HTTP or HTTP servers is necessary.
<li> Archive formats which are already widely deployed may be used. 
<li>Users do not need to have cryptographic tools to use
   files contained within these archives.
<li> Multiple signers.
<li> Multiple signing algorithms.
<li>  Allows different portions of archives to be signed by 
   different parties, as well as overlap, and unsigned files.
<li>Supports needs for Java archives and installable 
   software distributions.
<li>Adheres as much as possible to existing standards 
   (both file format and PKCS7 signing.)
<li> One signature verification per archive per signer.
<li> Progressive verification.
</ul>
<h2>2. Filenames in the archive</h2>

<p>Archives are signed by creating a "META-INF/" directory at the top
level of the path tree. A leading "/" is acceptable if other pathnames
contain a leading "/" (ie, "/META-INF/").

<p>There is exactly one manifest file in the archive, with pathname

<pre>
  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
</pre>

<p>Signature files have pathnames of the form

<pre>
  META-INF/x.SF
</pre>

for some string x containing only the characterse A-Z 0-9 and
dash or underscore. x must not be more than 8 characters.

<p> The encoding of non-ASCII characters in filenames (if they are
supported) is defined by the archive format or some other convention,
not by this specification. But filenames in the META-INF directory are
restricted as above.

<p> The names "META-INF", "MANIFEST.MF", and the filetype ".SF" should
be generated as uppercase, but recognized in any case.

<p> <h2>3. Name-Value pairs and sections</h2>

<p> In most cases, information contained within the manifest file or
signature files is represented as so-called "name: value" pairs
inspired by the RFC822 standard.

<p> Groups of name-value pairs are known as a "section". Sections are
separated from other sections by empty lines.

<p> Binary data of any form is represented as base64. Continuations
are required for binary data which causes line length to exceed 72
bytes. Examples of binary data are digests and signatures.

<p> Implementations shall support header values of up to 65535 bytes.

<h4>Specification:</h4> <pre>
  section: *header +newline
  nonempty-section: +header +newline
  newline: CR LF
         | LF
         | CR (not followed by LF)

; That 'not followed by LF' probably requires some minor
; ugliness in the parser. Sorry.

  header: alphanum *headerchar ":" SPACE *otherchar newline
          *continuation

  continuation: SPACE *otherchar newline

; RFC822 has +(SPACE | TAB), but this way continuation lines 
; never get mangled.

  alphanum: {"A"-"Z"} | {"a"-"z"} | {"0"-"9"}

  headerchar: alphanum | "-" | "_"

  otherchar: any Unicode character except NUL, CR and LF

; Also: To prevent mangling of files sent via straight e-mail, no 
; header will start with the four letters "From".

; When version numbering is used:

  number: {"0"-"9"}+

; The number needn't be, e.g. 1.11 is considered to be later
; than 1.9. Both major and minor versions must be 3 digits or less.
</pre>
<h2>4. Manifest file.</h2>

The manifest file consists of a list of files present
within the archive itself. Not all files in the archive need to be
listed in the manifest, but all files which are to be signed
must be listed. The manifest file itself must not be listed.

<p> A preliminary section appears at the top of the file containing,
at minimum, this standard's version number.  <pre>
  Manifest-Version: 1.0
</pre>
Optionally, a version required for use may be specified:
<pre>
  Required-Version: 1.0
</pre>
If Version: is higher than Required-Version, extensions may
be used. 

<p> The manifest file consists of sections which are entries for
various files in the archive.

<p> Many of the headers themselves are not covered by this
specification.  The following are required: <pre>
  Name: dirpath/whatever.class
  Digest-Algorithms: (list of algorithms)
  (algorithm)-Digest: (base-64 representation of digest)

</pre>

The "Name:" header shall contain a relative path to the file being
signed within the archive, OR an absolute URL referencing data outside
the archive.

<ul>
<li>Multiple digest algorithms may be listed (and corresponding (*)-Digest: lines
must exist for each one listed); at least one must be present.
<li> Two entries for the same file may not appear in the manifest file.
When duplicate entries do occur, only the first is recognized.
<li> Headers which are not understood are ignored. Such headers may 
include "policy": information used by applications.
</ul>

<h4>Example manifest file:</h4>
<pre>
  Manifest-Version: 1.0

  Name: common/class1.class
  Digest-Algorithms: MD5
  MD5-Digest: (base64 representation of MD5 digest)

  Name: common/class2.class
  Digest-Algorithms: MD5, SHA
  MD5-Digest: (base64 representation of MD5 digest)
  SHA-Digest: (base64 representation of SHA digest)

</pre>
<h4>Specification:</h4>
<pre>
  manifest-file: "Manifest-Version: 1.0" newline
                 manifest-start
                 *manifest-entry

  manifest-start: section

  ; Optional header is
  ;   Required-Version: number "." number
  ;
  ; Required-Version indicates that only tools of the given version
  ; or later can be used to manipulate the file.

; The value of Digest-Algorithms is a comma-separated-list:

  comma-separated-list: +headerchar "," *whitespace comma-separated-list
                      | +headerchar
</pre>
<h2>5. Signature instructions</h2>

<p> Each signer is represented by a signature file.

<p> A preliminary section appears at the top of the file containing,
at minimum, this standard's version number.  <pre>
  Signature-Version: 1.0
</pre>
Information supplied by the signer but not specific 
to any particular pathname should be included in this 
preliminary header.

<p> The major part of the file is similar form to the manifest file.
The purpose here is to allow "policy" to be embedded in headers
supplied by the signer rather than the manifest owner (who is normally
the person who generated the archive.)

<p> Signature files consist of sections which are essentially lists of
names, all of which must be present in the manifest file.  Extra
headers may be included here. A digest is also present, but this is a
digest of the entry in the manifest file.

<p> Paths or URL's appearing in the manifest file but not in the
signature file are not used in calculation. This allows subsets of the
archive to be signed.

<p> Only the Name: is required.

<p> <h4>Validating a file:</h4>

<p> The signature is first verified when the manifest is first
parsed. This verification can be remembered, for efficiency. This only
validates the signature directions themselves, not the actual archive
files.

<p> To validate a file, a digest value in the signature file is compared
against a digest calculated against the corresponding entry in the
manifest file. Then, a digest value in the manifest file is compared
against a digest calculated against the actual data referenced in the
"Name:" header -- relative path or URL.  <pre> Example signature file:

  Signature-Version: 1.0

  Name: common/class1.class
  Digest-Algorithms: MD5
  MD5-Digest: (base64 representation of MD5 digest)

  Name: common/class2.class
  Digest-Algorithms: MD5
  MD5-Digest: (base64 representation of MD5 digest)
</pre>
<h4>Specification:</h4>
<pre>
  signature-file: "Signature-Version: 1.0" newline
                  signature-start
                  *signature-entry
                  signature-end

  signature-start: section

; Optional header is
;   Required-Version: number "." number
; This has the same meaning as in manifest-start.
; The only required header is Name. Its format is the same
; as in a manifest-entry.
</pre>

<h4>The Magic Keyword</h4>

<p>Another <b>requirement</b> to validate the signature on a given
manifest entry is that the verifier understand the value or values of
the <code>Magic</code> key-pair value in that entry's manifest
entry. <p>The <code>Magic</code> key is <b>optional</b> but it is
<b>required</b> that a parser understand the value of an entry's
<code>Magic</code> key if it is verifying that entry's signature.

<p>The value or values of the key <code>Magic</code> are a set of
comma-separated context-specific strings. The spaces before and after
the commas are ignored. Case is ignored. The exact meaning of the
magic keywords is application specific. These keywords indicate how to
compute the hash value contained in the manifest entry, and are
therefore crucial to the proper verification of the signature. The
keywords may be used for dynamic or embedded content, multiple hashes
for multilingual documents, etc.

<p>Here are two examples of the potential use of <code>Magic</code>:
<pre>
	Name: http://www.scripts.com/index#script1
	Digest-Algorithms: SHA
	SHA-Digest: (base64 representation of SHA hash)
	Magic: JavaScript, Dynamic
</pre>
<pre>
	Name: http://www.tourist.com/guide.html
	Digest-Algorithms: SHA
	SHA-Digest: (base64 representation of SHA hash)
	SHA-Digest-French: (base64 representation of SHA hash)
	SHA-Digest-German: (base64 representation of SHA hash)
	Magic: Multilingual
</pre>

<p>In the first example, these <code>Magic</code> values may indicate
that the result of an http query is the script embedded in the
document, as opposed to the document itself, and also that the script
is generated dynamically. These two pieces of information indicate how
to compute the hash value against which to compare the Manifest's hash
value, thus comparing a valid signature.

<p>In the second example, the <code>Magic</code> value indicates that
the document retrieved may have been content-negotiated for a specific
language, and that the hash to verify against is dependent on which
language the document retrieved is written in.


<h2>6. Digital Signatures</h2>
A digital signature in the specification is a signed version
of the ".SF" (signature instructions) file. These are binary files
not intended to be interpreted by humans.

<p> Digital signature files have the same filename as the .SF file but
different extension. The extension varies depending on the type of
digital signature.  <pre>
  .RSA      (PKCS7 signature, MD5 + RSA)
  .DSA      (PKCS7 signature, DSA)
  .PGP      (Pretty Good Privacy Signature)
</pre>

For those formats that do not support external signed data, the file
shall consist of a signed copy of the .SF file. Thus some data may be
duplicated and a verifier ought to compare the two files.

<p> Formats that support external data either reference the ".SF"
file, or perform calculations on it with implicit reference.

<p> Each .SF file may have multiple digital signatures, but those
signatures ought to be generated by the same legal entity.

<p> Filetypes may be 1 to 3 "alphanum" characters. Filetypes
unrecognized must obviously be ignored.

<p> <h2>7. Notes</h2>

<p>

<h4>Before parsing:</h4>

<ul>
<li> if the last character of the file is an EOF character
  (code 26), the EOF is treated as whitespace.
<li> two newlines are appended (one for editors that don't
  put a newline at the end of the last line, and one so that
  the grammar doesn't have to special-case the last entry,
  which may not have a blank line after it).
</ul>
<h4>Headers:</h4>
<ul>
<li> In all cases for all sections, headers which are not 
  understood are ignored.
<li> Header names are case insensitive. Programs which generate
  manifest and signature files should use the cases shown in this 
  specification however.
<li> Header names cannot be repeated within a section.
</ul>
<h4>Versions:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Manifest-Version and Signature-Version must be
  first, and in exactly that case (so that they can be
  recognized easily as magic strings). Other than that, the
  order of headers within a section is not significant.
</ul>
<h4>Ordering:</h4>
<ul>
<li> The order of manifest-entries is not significant.
<li> The order of signature-entries is not significant, except that
  the digests that get signed are in the that order.
</ul>
<h4>Line length:</h4>
<ul>
<li> No line may be longer than 72 bytes (not characters), in
  its UTF8-encoded form. If a value would make the initial line
  longer than this, it should be continued on extra lines (each
  starting with a single SPACE).
</ul>
<h4>Errors:</h4>
<ul>
<li> If a file cannot be parsed according to this spec, a warning
  should be output, and none of the signatures should be trusted.
</ul>
<h4>Limitations:</h4>
<ul>
<li> because header names cannot be continued, the maximum
  length of a header name is 70 bytes (there must be a colon
  and a SPACE after the name).
<li> NUL, CR, and LF can't be embedded in header values, and NUL,
  CR, LF and ":" can't be embedded in header names. We could
  add quoting for these, but it probably isn't worth the
  extra complication. Another possibility would be to require
  them to be encoded using two bytes.
<li> It's more difficult to test conformance to the spec without
  limits on the complexity of a file. So, implementations
  should support 65535-byte (not character) header values,
  and 65535 headers per file. They might run out of memory,
  but there should not be hard-coded limits below these
  values.
</ul>
<h4>Signers: </h4>
<ul>
<li> It is technically possible that different entities may use 
  different signing algorithms to share a single signature file. This 
  violates the standard, and the extra signature may be ignored. 
</ul>
<h4>Algorithms:</h4>
<ul>
<li> No digest algorithm or signature algorithm is mandated by this
  standard. However, the following is generally expected:
<li>  Digest: At least one of MD5 and SHA
<li>  Signature: PKCS7
</ul>
