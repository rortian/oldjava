</ul><h1><a name="4597">
The RemoteObject Class
</a></h1>The <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> class implements the 
<code>java.lang.Object</code> behavior for remote objects. The <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code> 
methods are implemented to allow remote object references to be stored in 
hashtables and compared. The <code>equals</code> method returns true if two <code>Remote</code> 
objects refer to the same remote object. It compares the remote object references 
of the remote objects.
<p>The <code>toString</code> method returns a string describing the remote object. The 
contents and syntax of this string is implementation-specific and can vary.
<p>All of the other methods of <code>java.lang.Object</code> retain their original 
implementations.
<p><dl><a name="4601"><pre>package java.rmi.server;
public abstract class RemoteObject
	implements java.rmi.Remote, java.io.Serializable
{
	public int hashCode();
	public boolean equals(Object obj);
	public String toString();
}
</pre></a></dl><h1><a name="5462">
The RemoteServer Class
</a></h1>The <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteServer</code> class is the common superclass to all 
server implementations and provides the framework to support a wide range 
of remote reference semantics.   At present the only subclass supported is 
<code>UnicastRemoteObject</code>.
<p><dl><a name="3358"><pre>package java.rmi.server;
public abstract class RemoteServer
	extends RemoteObject {

	public static String getClientHost()
		throws ServerNotActiveException;

	public static void setLog(java.io.OutputStream out);
</pre></a><a name="4613"><pre>
	public static java.io.PrintStream getLog();
}
</pre></a></dl>The <code>getClientHost</code> method allows an active method to determine the host 
that initiated the remote method active in the current thread. The 
<code>ServerNotActiveException</code> is thrown if no remote method is active on the 
current thread. The <code>setLog</code> method logs RMI calls to the specified output 
stream. If the output stream is null, call logging is turned off. The <code>getLog</code> 
method returns the stream for the RMI call log, so that application-specific 
information can be written to the call log in a synchronized manner.
<p><h1><a name="5794">
The UnicastRemoteObject Class
</a></h1>The <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code> class provides support for 
point-to-point active object references using TCP-based streams. The class 
implements a remote server object with the following characteristics:
<p><ul><li>References are valid only for, at most, the life of the process that creates the 
remote object.
<li>A TCP connection-based transport is used.
<li>Invocations, parameters, and results use a stream protocol for 
communicating between client and server.
<dl><a name="274"><pre>package java.rmi.server;
public class UnicastRemoteObject extends RemoteServer {

	protected UnicastRemoteObject()
		throws java.rmi.RemoteException;

	public Object clone()
		throws java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException;

	public static RemoteStub exportObject(java.rmi.Remote obj)
		throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}
</pre></a></dl></ul><h2><a name="2175">
Constructing a New Remote Object
</a></h2>In a Java virtual machine running as a server, remote objects defined by the 
developer can be created by the server application. When a remote object class 
extends <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code>, the constructor creates and exports a remote 
object. The constructor is invoked from the corresponding constructor of the 
remote object class. The default constructor creates a new unicast remote object 
using an anonymous port.
<p>The clone method is used to create a unicast remote object with initially the 
same contents, but is exported to accept remote calls and is distinct from the 
original object.
<p><h2><a name="728">
Exporting an Implementation Not Extended From RemoteObject
</a></h2>The &#32;<code>exportObject</code> method is used to export a simple peer-to-peer remote 
object that is not implemented by extending the <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> class. 
The <code>exportObject</code> method is called with the object to be exported on an 
anonymous port. The object <em>must</em> be exported prior to the first time it is passed 
in an RMI call as either a parameter or return value; otherwise, a 
<code>java.rmi.server.</code><code>StubNotFoundException</code> is thrown when a remote call 
is attempted in which an "unexported" remote object is passed as an argument 
or return value.
<p>Once exported, the object can be passed as an argument in an RMI call or 
returned as the result of an RMI call. When a remote object is passed, during 
marshaling a lookup is performed to find the matching remote stub for the 
remote object implementation and that stub is passed or returned instead.
<p>The <code>exportObject</code> method returns a <code>RemoteStub</code> which is the stub object for 
the remote object, obj, that is passed in place of the remote object in an RMI 
call.
<p><h2><a name="6811">
Passing a UnicastRemoteObject in an RMI Call
</a></h2>As stated above, when an object of type <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> is passed as 
a parameter or return value in an RMI call, the object is replaced by the remote 
object's stub. A remote object implementation remains in the virtual machine 
in which it was created and does not move (even by value) from that virtual 
machine. In other words, a remote object is passed by reference in an RMI call; 
remote objects cannot be passsed by value.
<p><h2><a name="6785">
Serializing a UnicastRemoteObject
</a></h2>Information contained in <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> is transient and is not saved 
if an object of that type is written to a user-defined <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> (for 
example, if the object is written to a file using serialization). An object that is 
an instance of a user-defined subclass of <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code>, however, 
may have non-transient data that can be saved when the object is serialized.
<p>When a <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> is read from an <code>ObjectInputStream</code>, it is 
automatically exported to the RMI runtime so that it may receive RMI calls. If 
exporting the object fails for some reason, deserializing the object will 
terminate with an exception.
<p><h1><a name="179">
The Unreferenced Interface
</a></h1><dl><a name="182"><pre>package java.rmi.server;
public interface Unreferenced {
	public void unreferenced();
}
</pre></a></dl>The <code>java.rmi.server.Unreferenced</code> interface allows a server object to 
receive notification that there are no clients holding remote references to it. The 
distributed garbage collection mechanism maintains for each remote object, the 
set of client virtual machines that hold references that remote object. As long as 
some client holds a remote reference to the remote object, the RMI runtime 
keeps a local reference to the remote object. When the "reference" set becomes 
empty, the <code>Unreferenced.unreferenced</code> method is invoked (if the server 
implements the <code>Unreferenced</code> interface). A remote object is <em>not</em> required to 
support the <code>Unreferenced</code> interface.
<p>As long as some local reference to the remote object exists it may be passed in 
remote calls or returned to clients. The process that receives the reference is 
added to the reference set for the reference. When the reference set becomes 
empty, <code>Unreferenced</code> will be invoked. As such, the <code>Unreferenced</code> method 
can be called more than once (each time the set is newly emptied). Remote 
objects are only collected when no more references, either local references or 
those held by clients, still exist.

}
</pre></a></dl>The <code>RMISecurityManager</code> can be used when the application does not require 
specialized security functions but does need the protection it provides. This 
simple security manger disables all functions except class definition and 
access, so that other classes for remote objects, their arguments, and returns 
can be loaded as needed. A downloaded class is allowed to make a connection 
if the connection was initiated via the RMI transport.
<p>If no security manager has been set, stub loading is disabled. This ensures that 
some security manager is responsible for the actions of loaded stubs and 
classes as part of any remote method invocation. A security manager is set 
using <code>System.setSecurityManager</code>.
<p><h1><a name="1639">
The RMIClassLoader Class
</a></h1>The<code> java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader</code> is a utility class that can be used 
by applications to load classes via a URL.
<p><dl><a name="6620"><pre>package java.rmi.server;

public class RMIClassLoader {

    public static Class loadClass(String name)
	    throws MalformedURLException, ClassNotFoundException;

    public static synchronized Class loadClass(URL codebase,
		String name) throws MalformedURLException, 
		ClassNotFoundException;

	public static Object getSecurityContext(ClassLoader loader);
}
</pre></a></dl>The first <code>loadClass</code> method loads the specified class name via the URL 
defined by the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property. The class is loaded, 
defined, and returned.
<p>The second form of the <code>loadClass</code> method loads the specified class name via 
the URL parameter codebase.
<p>The <code>getSecurityContext</code> method returns the security context of the given 
class loader, loader. The security context is obtained by querying the 
<code>LoaderHandler</code>'s <code>getSecurityContext</code> method.
<p><em>The RMI runtime uses its own class loader to load stubs, skeletons, and 
other classes needed by the stubs and skeletons. These classes, and the way 
they are used, support the safety properties of the Java RMI runtime. This class 
loader always loads locally-available classes first. Only if a security manager is 
in force will stubs be loaded from either the local machine or from a network 
source. 

The class loader keeps a cache of loaders for individual Uniform Resource 
Locators (URLs) and the classes that have been loaded from them. When a stub 
or skeleton has been loaded, any class references that occur as parameters or 
returns will be loaded (from their originating codebase host) and are subject to 
the same security restrictions. 

Server processes must declare to the RMI runtime the location of the classes 
(stubs and parameters/returns) that will be available to its clients. The 
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property should be a URL from which stub 
classes and classes used by stubs will be loaded, using the normal protocols, 
such as http and ftp.
</em><p><h1><a name="6583">
The LoaderHandler Interface
</a></h1><dl><a name="6586"><pre>package java.rmi.server;

public interface LoaderHandler {

    Class loadClass(String name)
	    throws MalformedURLException, ClassNotFoundException;

    Class loadClass(URL codebase,String name) 
		throws MalformedURLException, ClassNotFoundException;

	Object getSecurityContext(ClassLoader loader);
}
</pre></a></dl>The <code>LoaderHandler</code> interface must be implemented by a class named 
<code>LoaderHandler</code>. The <code>LoaderHandler</code> class must be defined in the package 
specified by the property <code>java.rmi.loader.packagePrefix</code>. The methods 
of <code>LoaderHandler</code> are used by the <code>java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader</code> 
class to carry out its operations.
<p><h1><a name="4175">
The RMISocketFactory Class
</a></h1>The<code> java.rmi.server.RMISocketFactory </code>abstract class provides an 
interface for specifying how the transport should obtain sockets.
<p><dl><a name="4329"><pre>package java.rmi.server;
public abstract class RMISocketFactory {

	public abstract java.net.Socket createSocket(String h,int p)
		throws IOException;

	public abstract java.net.ServerSocket createServerSocket(int p)
		throws IOException;

	public static void setSocketFactory(RMISocketFactory fac)
		throws IOException;

	public static RMISocketFactory getSocketFactory();

	public static void setFailureHandler(RMIFailureHandler fh);

	public static RMIFailureHandler getFailureHandler();
}
</pre></a></dl>The static method <code>setSocketFactory</code> is used to set the socket factory from 
which RMI obtains sockets. The application may invoke this method with its 
own <code>RMISocketFactory</code> instance only once. An application-defined 
implementation of <code>RMISocketFactory</code> could, for example, do preliminary 
filtering on the requested connection and throw exceptions, or return its own 
extension of the <code>java.net.Socket</code> or <code>java.net.ServerSocket</code> classes, 
such as ones that provide a secure communication channel. Note that the 
RMISocketFactory may only be set if the current security manager allows 
setting a socket factory; if setting the socket factory is disallowed, a 
<code>SecurityException</code> will be thrown.
<p>The static method <code>getSocketFactory</code> returns the socket factory used by 
RMI. The method returns null if the socket factory is not set.
<p>The transport layer invokes the <code>createSocket</code> and <code>createServerSocket</code> 
methods on the <code>RMISocketFactory</code> returned by the <code>getSocketFactory</code> 
method when the transport needs to create sockets. For example:
<p><dl><a name="4524"><pre>RMISocketFactory.getSocketFactory().createSocket(myhost, myport)
</pre></a></dl>The method <code>createSocket</code> should create a client socket connected to the 
specified host and port. The method <code>createServerSocket</code> should create a 
server socket on the specified port. The default transport's implementation of 
<code>RMISocketFactory</code> provides for transparent RMI through firewalls using 
HTTP as follows:
<p><ul><li>On <code>createSocket</code>, the factory automatically attempts HTTP connections to 
hosts that cannot be contacted with a direct socket.
<li>On <code>createServerSocket</code>, the factory returns a server socket that 
automatically detects if a newly accepted connection is an HTTP POST 
request. If so, it returns a socket that will transparently expose only the body 
of the request to the transport and format its output as an HTTP response.
</ul>The method <code>setFailureHandler</code> sets the failure handler to be called by the 
RMI runtime if the creation of a server socket fails. The failure handler returns 
a boolean to indicate if retry should occur. The default failure handler returns 
false, meaning that by default recreation of sockets is not attempted by the 
runtime.
<p>The method <code>getFailureHandler</code> returns the current handler for socket 
creation failure, or null if the failure handler is not set.
<p><h1><a name="4381">
The RMIFailureHandler Interface
</a></h1>The <code>java.rmi.server.RMIFailureHandler</code> interface provides a method 
for specifying how the RMI runtime should respond when server socket 
creation fails.
<p><dl><a name="4384"><pre>package java.rmi.server;
</pre></a><a name="4393"><pre>public interface RMIFailureHandler {
	public boolean failure(Exception ex);
}
</pre></a></dl>The <code>failure</code> method is invoked with the exception that prevented the RMI 
runtime from creating a <code>java.net.Socket</code> or <code>java.net.ServerSocket</code>. 
The method returns true if the runtime should attempt to retry and false 
otherwise.
<p>Before this method can be invoked, a failure handler needs to be registered via 
the <code>RMISocketFactory.setFailureHandler</code> call. If the failure handler is 
not set, creation is not attempted.
<p><h1><a name="1621">
The LogStream Class
</a></h1>The class <code>LogStream</code> presents a mechanism for logging errors that are of 
possible interest to those monitoring the system. This class is used internally 
for server call logging.
<p><dl><a name="4830"><pre>package java.rmi.server;

public class LogStream extends java.io.PrintStream {

	public static LogStream log(String name);

	public static synchronized PrintStream getDefaultStream();

	public static synchronized void setDefaultStream(
</pre></a><a name="6209"><pre>		PrintStream newDefault);

	public synchronized OutputStream getOutputStream();

	public synchronized void setOutputStream(OutputStream out);

	public void write(int b);

	public void write(byte b[], int off, int len);

	public String toString();

	public static int parseLevel(String s);

	// constants for logging levels
	public static final int SILENT  = 0;
	public static final int BRIEF   = 10;
	public static final int VERBOSE = 20;
}
</pre></a></dl>The method <code>log</code> returns the LogStream identified by the given name. If a log 
corresponding to name does not exist, a log using the default stream is created.
<p>The method <code>getDefaultStream</code> returns the current default stream for new 
logs.
<p>The method <code>setDefaultStream</code> sets the default stream for new logs.
<p>The method <code>getOutputStream</code> returns current stream to which output from 
this log is sent.
<p>The method <code>setOutputStream</code> sets the stream to which output from this log 
is sent.
<p>The first form of the method <code>write</code> writes a byte of data to the stream. If it is 
not a new line, then the byte is appended to the internal buffer. If it is a new 
line, then the currently buffered line is sent to the log's output stream with the 
appropriate logging prefix. The second form of the method <code>write</code> writes a 
subarray of bytes.
<p>The method <code>toString</code> returns log name as string representation.
<p>The method <code>parseLevel</code> converts a string name of a logging level to its 
internal integer representation.
<p><h1><a name="5845">
Stub and Skeleton Compiler
</a></h1>The <code>rmic</code> stub and skeleton compiler is used to compile the appropriate stubs 
and skeletons for a specific remote object implementation. The compiler is 
invoked with the package qualified class name of the remote object class. The 
class must previously have been compiled successfully.
<p><ul><li>The location of the imported classes may be specified either with the 
CLASSPATH environment variable or with the -classpath argument.
<li>The compiled class files are placed in the current directory unless the -d 
argument is specified following the same mechanism for writing class files 
as <code>javac</code>.
<li>The -keepgenerated argument retains the generated java source files for the 
stubs and skeletons.
<li>The -show option displays a graphical user interface for the program.
<li>All other <code>javac</code> command line arguments are applicable and can be used 
with <code>rmic</code>.
