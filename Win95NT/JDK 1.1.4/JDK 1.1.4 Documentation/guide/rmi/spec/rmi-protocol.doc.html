Overview
</a></h1>The RMI protocol makes use of two other protocols for its on-the-wire format: 
Java Object Serialization and HTTP. The Object Serialization protocol is used to 
marshal call and return data. The HTTP protocol is used to "POST" a remote 
method invocation and obtain return data when circumstances warrant. Each 
protocol is documented as a separate grammar. Nonterminal symbols in 
production rules may refer to rules governed by another protocol (either Object 
Serialization or HTTP). When a protocol boundary is crossed, subsequent 
productions use that embedded protocol. 
<p><h3><a name="3245">
Notes about Grammar Notation
</a></h3><ul><li>We use a similar notation to that used in the Java Language Specification 
(see section 2.3 of the JLS).
<li>Control codes in the stream are represented by literal values expressed in 
hexadecimal.
<li>Some nonterminal symbols in the grammar represent application specific 
values supplied in a method invocation. The definition of such a 
nonterminal consists of its Java type. A table mapping each of these 
nonterminals to its respective type follows the grammar.
</ul><h1><a name="3249">
RMI Transport Protocol
</a></h1>	The wire format for RMI is represented by a <em>Stream</em>. The terminology adopted 
here reflects a client perspective. <em>Out</em> refers to output messages and <em>In</em> refers to 
input messages. The contents of the transport header are <em>not</em> formatted using 
Object Serialization. 
<p><dl><pre><em>Stream:
	Out
	In
</em></pre></dl>The input and output streams used by RMI are paired. Each <em>Out</em> stream has a 
corresponding <em>In</em> stream. An <em>Out</em> stream in the grammar maps to the output 
stream of a socket (from the client's perspective). An <em>In</em> stream (in the 
grammar) is paired with the corresponding socket's input stream. Since output 
and input streams are paired, the only header information needed on an input 
stream is an acknowledgment as to whether the protocol is understood; other 
header information (such as the magic number and version number) can be 
implied by the context of stream pairing.
<p><h2><a name="3252">
Format of an Output Stream
</a></h2>An output stream in RMI consists of transport <em>Header</em> information followed by 
a sequence of <em>Messages</em>. Alternatively, an output stream can contain an 
invocation embedded in the HTTP protocol.
<p><dl><pre><em>Out:
	Header Messages
	HttpMessage
</em></pre><pre><em>Header</em>:
	<code>0x4a 0x52 0x4d 0x49</code> <em>Version Protocol</em>
</pre><pre><em>Version</em>:
	<code>0x00 0x01
</code></pre><pre><em>Protocol:
	StreamProtocol
	SingleOpProtocol
	MultiplexProtocol
</em></pre><pre><em>StreamProtocol</em>:
	<code>0x4b
</code></pre><pre><em>SingleOpProtocol</em>:
	<code>0x4c
</code></pre><pre><em>MultiplexProtocol</em>:
	<code>0x4d
</code></pre><pre><em>Messages:
	Message
	Messages Message
</em></pre></dl>The <em>Messages</em> are wrapped within a particular protocol as specified by <em>Protocol</em>. 
For the <em>SingleOpProtocol</em>, there may only be one <em>Message</em> after the <em>Header</em>, and 
there is no additional data that the <em>Message</em> is wrapped in. The <em>SingleOpProtocol</em> 
is used for invocation embedded in HTTP requests, where interaction beyond a 
single request and response is not possible.
<p>For the <em>StreamProtocol</em> and the <em>MultiplexProtocol</em>, the server must respond with 
a a byte <code>0x4e</code> acknowledging support for the protocol, and an 
<em>EndpointIdentifier</em> that contains the host name and port number that the server 
can see is being used by the client. The client can use this information to 
determine its host name if it is otherwise unable to do that for security reasons. 
The client must then respond with another <em>EndpointIdentifier</em> that contains the 
client's default endpoint for accepting connections. This can be used by a 
server in the <em>MultiplexProtocol</em> case to identify the client.
<p>For the <em>StreamProtocol</em>, after this endpoint negotiation, the <em>Messages</em> are sent 
over the output stream without any additional wrapping of the data. For the 
<em>MultiplexProtocol</em>, the socket connection is used as the concrete connection for a 
multiplexed connection, as described in <a href="rmi-protocol.doc.html#3477">RMI's Multiplexing 
Protocol</a>. Virtual connections initiated over this multiplexed connection 
consist of a series of <em>Messages</em> as described below.
<p>There are three types of output messages: <em>Call</em>, <em>Ping</em> and <em>DgcAck</em>. A <em>Call</em> 
encodes a method invocation. A <em>Ping</em> is a transport-level message for testing 
liveness of a remote virtual machine. A <em>DGCAck</em> is an acknowledgment 
directed to a server's distributed garbage collector that indicates that remote 
objects in a return value from a server have been received by the client.
<p><dl><pre><em>Message:
	Call
	Ping
	DgcAck
</em></pre><pre><em>Call</em>:
	<code>0x50</code> CallData
</pre><pre><em>Ping</em>:
	<code>0x52
</code></pre><pre><em>DgcAck</em>:
	<code>0x54</code> <em>UniqueIdentifier	
</em></pre></dl><h2><a name="3263">
Format of an Input Stream
</a></h2>There are currently three types of input messages: <em>ReturnData</em>, <em>HttpReturn</em> and 
<em>PingAck</em>. <em>ReturnData</em> is the result of a "normal" RMI call. An <em>HttpReturn</em> is a 
return result from an invocation embedded in the HTTP protocol. A <em>PingAck</em> is 
the acknowledgment for a <em>Ping</em> message.
<p><dl><pre><em>In:
	ProtocolAck Returns
	ProtocolNotSupported
	HttpReturn
</em></pre><pre><em>ProtocolAck</em>:
	<code>0x4e</code>
</pre><pre><em>ProtocolNotSupported</em>:
	<code>0x4f
</code></pre><pre><em>Returns:
	Return
	Returns Return
</em></pre><pre><em>Return:
	ReturnData
	PingAck
</em></pre><pre><em>ReturnData</em>:
	<code>0x51</code> <em>ReturnValue<sub>opt
</sub></em></pre><pre><em>PingAck</em>:
	<code>0x53
</code></pre></dl><h1><a name="3270">
RMI's Use of Object Serialization Protocol
</a></h1>Call and return data in RMI calls are formatted using the Java Object 
Serialization protocol. Each method invocation's <em>CallData</em> is represented by the 
<em>ObjectIdentifier</em> (the target of the call), an <em>Operation</em> (a number representing the 
method to be invoked), a <em>Hash</em> (a number that verifies that client stub and 
remote object skeleton use the same stub protocol), followed by a list of zero or 
more <em>Arguments</em> for the call. 
<p><dl><pre><em>CallData:
	ObjectIdentifier Operation Hash Arguments<sub>opt
</sub></em></pre><pre><em>ObjectIdentifier:
	ObjectNumber UniqueIdentifier
</em></pre><pre><em>UniqueIdentifier:
	Number Time Count
</em></pre><pre><em>Arguments:
	Value
	Arguments Value
</em></pre><pre><em>Value:
	Object
	Primitive
</em></pre></dl>A <em>ReturnValue</em> of an RMI call consists of a return code to indicate either a 
normal or exceptional return, a <em>UniqueIdentifier</em> to tag the return value (used to 
send a DGCAck if necessary) followed by the return result: either the <em>Value</em> 
returned or the <em>Exception </em>thrown<em>.
</em><p><dl><pre><em>ReturnValue</em>:
	<code>0x01</code> <em>UniqueIdentifier Value</em>
	<code>0x02</code> <em>UniqueIdentifier Exception</em>
</pre></dl><em><em>ObjectIdentifier</em>, <em>UniqueIdentifier, </em>and<em> EndpointIdentifier </em>are not written 
out using default serialization, but each uses its own special <code>write</code> method 
(this is not the <code>writeObject</code> method used by Object Serialization); the <code>write</code> 
method for each type of identifier adds its component data consecutively to the 
output stream.
</em><p><h1><a name="3278">
RMI's Use of HTTP POST Protocol
</a></h1>In order to invoke remote methods through a firewall, some RMI calls make 
use of the HTTP protocol, more specifically HTTP POST. The URL specified in 
the post header can be one of the following:
<p><dl><pre>	<code>http://</code><em>&lt;host&gt;<code>:</code>&lt;port&gt;<code></em>/ 
</code>	<code>http://</code><em>&lt;host&gt;</em><code>:80/cgi-bin/java-rmi?forward=</code><em>&lt;port&gt;</em>
</em></pre></dl>The first URL is used for direct communication with an RMI server on the 
specific <em>host</em> and <em>port</em>. The second URL form is used to invoke a "cgi" script on 
the server which forwards the invocation to the server on the specified <em>port</em>.
<p>An <em>HttpPostHeader</em> is a standard HTTP header for a POST request. An 
<em>HttpResponseHeader</em> is a standard HTTP response to a post. If the response 
status code is not 200, then it is assumed that there is no <em>Return</em>. Note that only 
a single RMI call is embedded in an HTTP POST request.
<p><dl><pre><em>HttpMessage:
	HttpPostHeader Header Message
</em></pre><pre><em>HttpReturn:
	HttpResponseHeader Return
</em></pre></dl><em>Only the <em>SingleOpProtocol</em> appears in the <em>Header</em> of an <em>HttpMessage</em>. An 
HttpReturn does not contain a protocol acknowledgment byte.

RMI's Multiplexing Protocol
</a></h1>The purpose of multiplexing is to provide a model where two endpoints can 
each open multiple full duplex connections to the other endpoint in an 
environment where only one of the endpoints is able to open such a 
bidirectional connection using some other facility (e.g., a TCP connection). RMI 
use this simple multiplexing protocol to allow a client to connect to an RMI 
server object in some situations where that is otherwise not possible. For 
example, some security managers for applet environments disallow the 
creation of server sockets to listen for incoming connections, thereby 
preventing such applets to export RMI objects and service remote calls from 
direct socket connections.   If the applet <em>can</em> open a normal socket connection to 
its codebase host, however, then it can use the multiplexing protocol over that 
connection to allow the codebase host to invoke methods on RMI objects 
exported by the applet. This section describes how the format and rules of the 
multiplexing protocol.
<p><h2><a name="3553">
Definitions
</a></h2>This sections defines some terms as they are used in the rest of the description 
of the protocol.
<p>An <em>endpoint</em> is one of the two users of a connection using the multiplexing 
protocol.
<p>The multiplexing protocol must layer on top of one existing bidirectional, 
reliable byte stream, presumably initiated by one of the endpoints to the other. 
In current RMI usage, this is always a TCP connection, made with a 
java.net.Socket object. This connection will be referred to as the <em>concrete 
connection</em>.
<p>The multiplexing protocol facilitates the use of <em>virtual connections</em>, which are 
themselves bidirectional, reliable byte streams, representing a particular 
session between two endpoints. The set of virtual connections between two 
endpoints over a single concrete connection comprises a <em>multiplexed connection</em>. 
Using the multiplexing protocol, virtual connections can be opened and closed 
by either endpoint. The state of an virtual connection with respect to a given 
endpoint is defined by the elements of the multiplexing protocol that are sent 
and received over the concrete connection. Such state involves if the 
connection is open or closed, the actual data that has been transmitted across, 
and the related flow control mechanisms. If not otherwise qualified, the term 
<em>connection</em> used in the remainder of this section means <em>virtual connection</em>.
<p>A virtual connections within a given multiplexed connection is identified by a 
16 bit integer, known as the <em>connection identifier</em>. Thus, there exist 65,536 
possible virtual connections in one multiplexed connection. The 
implementation may limit the number of these virtual connections that may be 
used simultaneously.
<p><h2><a name="3713">
Connection State and Flow Control
</a></h2>Connections are manipulated using the various <em>operations</em> defined by the 
multiplexing protocol. The following are the names of the operations defined 
by the protocol: OPEN, CLOSE, CLOSEACK, REQUEST, and TRANSMIT. The 
exact format and rules for all the operations are detailed in <a href="rmi-protocol.doc.html#3494">Protocol Format</a>.
<p>The OPEN, CLOSE, and CLOSEACK operations control connections becoming 
opened and closed, while the REQUEST and TRANSMIT operations are used 
to transmit data across an open connection within the constraints of the flow 
control mechanism.
<p><h3><a name="3917">
Connection States
</a></h3>A virtual connection is <em>open</em> with respect to a particular endpoint if the 
endpoint has sent an OPEN operation for that connection, or it has received an 
OPEN operation for that connection (and it had not been subsequently closed). 
The various protocol operations are described below.
<p>A virtual connection is <em>pending close</em> with respect to a particular endpoint if the 
endpoint has sent a CLOSE operation for that connection, but it has not yet 
received a subsequent CLOSE or CLOSEACK operation for that connection.
<p>A virtual connection is <em>closed</em> with respect to a particular endpoint if it has 
never been opened, or if it has received a CLOSE or a CLOSEACK operation 
for that connection (and it has not been subsequently opened).
<p><h3><a name="3921">
Flow Control
</a></h3>The multiplexing protocol using a simple packeting flow control mechanism to 
allow multiple virtual connections to exist in parallel over the same concrete 
connection. The high level requirement of the flow control mechanism is that 
the state of all virtual connections is independent; the state of one connection 
may not affect the behavior of others. For example, if the data buffers handling 
data coming in from one connection become full, this cannot prevent the 
transmission and processing of data for any other connection. This is necessary 
if the proceedings of one connection is dependent on the completion of the use 
of another connection, such as would happen with recursive RMI calls. 
Therefore, the practical implication is that the implementation must always be 
able to consume and process all of the multiplexing protocol data ready for 
input on the concrete connection (assuming that it conforms to this 
specification).
<p>Each endpoint has two state values associated with each connection: how 
many bytes of data the endpoint has requested but not received (<em>input request 
count</em>) and how many bytes the other endpoint has requested but have not 
been supplied by this endpoint (<em>output request count</em>).
<p>An endpoint's output request count is increased when it receives a REQUEST 
operation from the other endpoint, and it is decreased when it sends a 
TRANSMIT operation. An endpoint's input request count is increased when it 
sends a REQUEST operation, and it is decreased when it receives a TRANSMIT 
operation. It is a protocol violation if either of these values becomes negative.
<p>It is a protocol violation for an endpoint to send a REQUEST operation that 
would increase its input request count to more bytes that it can currently 
handle without blocking. It should, however, make sure that its input request 
count is greater than zero if the user of the connection is waiting to read data.
<p>It is a protocol violation for an endpoint to send a TRANSMIT operation 
containing more bytes that its output request count. It may buffer outgoing 
data until the user of the connection requests that data written to the 
connection be explicitly flushed. If data must be sent over the connection, 
however, by either an explicit flush or because the implementation's output 
buffers are full, then the user of the connection may be blocked until sufficient 
TRANSMIT operations can proceed.
<p>Beyond the rules outlined above, implementations are free to send REQUEST 
and TRANSMIT operations as deemed appropriate. For example, an endpoint 
may request more data for a connection even if its input buffer is not empty.
<p><h2><a name="3494">
Protocol Format
</a></h2>The byte stream format of the multiplexing protocol consists of a contiguous 
series of variable length records. The first byte of the record is an operation 
code that identifies the operation of the record and determines the format of 
the rest of its content. The following legal operation codes are defined:
<p>
<pre>
	Value		Name
	-----		----

	0xE1		OPEN
	0xE2		CLOSE
	0xE3		CLOSEACK
	0xE4		REQUEST
	0xE5		TRANSMIT
</pre>
<p>It is a protocol violation if the first byte of a record is not one of the defined 
operation codes. The following sections describe the format of the records for 
each operation code.
<p><h3><a name="3498">
OPEN operation
</a></h3>This is the format for records of the OPEN operation:
<p>
<pre>
	size (bytes)		Name		Description
	------------		----		-----------

	1			<em>opcode</em>		operation code (OPEN)
	2			<em>ID</em>		connection identifier
</pre>
<p>An endpoint sends an OPEN operation to open the indicated connection. It is a 
protocol violation if <em>ID</em> refers to a connection that is currently open or pending 
close with respect to the sending endpoint. After the connection is opened, 
both input and request count states for the connection are zero for both 
endpoints.
<p>Receipt of an OPEN operation indicates that the other endpoint is opening the 
indicated connection. After the connection is opened, both input and output 
request count states for the connection are zero for both endpoints.
<p>To prevent identifier collisions between the two endpoints, the space of valid 
connection identifiers is divided in half, depending on the value of the most 
significant bit. Each endpoint is only allowed to open connections with a 
particular value for the high bit. The endpoint that initiated the concrete 
connection must only open connections with the high bit set in the identifier 
and the other endpoint must only open connections with a zero in the high bit. 
For example, if an RMI applet that cannot create a server socket initiates a 
multiplexed connection to its codebase host, the applet may open virtual 
connections in the identifier range 0x8000-7FFF, and the server may open 
virtual connection in the identifier range 0-0x7FFF.
<p><h3><a name="3503">
CLOSE operation
</a></h3>This is the format for records of the CLOSE operation:
<p>
<pre>
	Size (bytes)		Name		Description
	------------		----		-----------

	1			<em>opcode</em>		operation code (OPEN)
	2			<em>ID</em>		connection identifier
</pre>

<p>An endpoint sends a CLOSE operation to close the indicated connection. It is a 
protocol violation if <em>ID</em> refers to a connection that is currently closed or 
pending close with respect to the sending endpoint (it may be pending close 
with respect to the receiving endpoint if it has also sent a CLOSE operation for 
this connection). After sending the CLOSE, the connection becomes pending 
close for the sending endpoint. Thus, it may not reopen the connection until it 
has received a CLOSE or a CLOSEACK for it from the other endpoint.
<p>Receipt of a CLOSE operation indicates that the other endpoint has closed the 
indicated connection, and it thus becomes closed on the receiving endpoint. 
Although the receiving endpoint may not send any more operations for this 
connection (until it is opened again), it still should provide data in the 
implementation's input buffers to readers of the connection. If the connection 
had previously been open instead of pending close, the receiving endpoint 
must respond with a CLOSEACK operation for the connection.
<p><h3><a name="3510">
 CLOSEACK operation
</a></h3>The following is the format for records with the CLOSEACK operation:
<p>
<pre>
	size (bytes)		Name		Description
	------------		----		-----------

	1			<em>opcode</em>		operation code (OPEN)
	2			<em>ID</em>		connection identifier
</pre>

<p>An endpoint sends a CLOSEACK operation to acknowledge a CLOSE 
operation from the receiving endpoint. It is a protocol violation if ID refers to a 
connection that is not pending close for the receiving endpoint when the 
operation is received.
<p>Receipt of a CLOSEACK operation changes the state of the indicated 
connection from pending close to closed, and thus the connection may be 
reopened in the future.
<p><h3><a name="3514">
REQUEST operation
</a></h3>This is the format for records of the REQUEST operation:
<p>
<pre>
	size (bytes)		Name		Description
	------------		----		-----------

	1			<em>opcode</em>		operation code (OPEN)
	2			<em>ID</em>		connection identifier
	4			<em>count</em>		number of additional bytes requested
</pre>

<p>An endpoint sends a REQUEST operation to increase its input request count 
for the indicated connection. It is a protocol violation if <em>ID</em> does not refer to a 
connection that is open with respect to the sending endpoint. The endpoint's 
input request count is incremented by the value <em>count</em>. The value of <em>count</em> is a 
signed 32 bit integer, and it is a protocol violation if it is negative or zero.
<p>Receipt of a REQUEST operation causes the output request count for the 
indicated connection to increase by <em>count</em>. If the connection is pending close by 
the receiving endpoint, then any REQUEST operations may be ignored.
<p><h3><a name="3520">
TRANSMIT operation
</a></h3>This is the format for records of the TRANSMIT operation.
<p>
<pre>
	size (bytes)		Name		Description
	------------		----		-----------

	1			<em>opcode</em>		operation code (OPEN)
	2			<em>ID</em>		connection identifier
	4			<em>count</em>		number of bytes in transmission
	<em>count			data</em>		transmission data
</pre>
<p>An endpoint sends a TRANSMIT operation to actually transmit data over the 
indicated connection. It is a protocol violation if ID does not refer to a 
connection that is open with respect to the sending endpoint. The endpoint's 
output request count is decremented by the value <em>count</em>. The value of <em>count</em> is a 
signed 32 bit integer, and it is a protocol violation if it is negative or zero. It is 
also a protocol violation if the TRANSMIT operation would cause the sending 
endpoint's output request count to become negative.
<p>Receipt of a TRANSMIT operation causes the count bytes of data to be added 
to the queue of bytes available for reading from the connection. The receiving 
endpoint's input request count is decremented by <em>count</em>. If this causes the input 
request count to become zero and the user of the connection is trying to read 
more data, the endpoint should respond with another REQUEST operation. If 
the connection is pending close by the receiving endpoint, then any 
TRANSMIT operations may be ignored.
<p><h3><a name="3743">
Protocol Violations
</a></h3>If a protocol violation occurs, as defined above or if a communication error is 
detected in the concrete connection, then the multiplexed connection is <em>shut 
down</em>. The real connection is terminated, and all virtual connections become 
closed immediately. Data already available for reading from virtual 
connections may be read by the users of the connections.
