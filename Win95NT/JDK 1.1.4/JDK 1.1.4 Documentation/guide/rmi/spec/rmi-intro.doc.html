Overview
</a></h1>Distributed systems require that computations running in different address 
spaces, potentially on different hosts, be able to communicate. For a basic 
communication mechanism, the Java language supports sockets, which are 
flexible and sufficient for general communication. However, sockets require the 
client and server to engage in applications-level protocols to encode and 
decode messages for exchange, and the design of such protocols is 
cumbersome and can be error-prone. 
<p>An alternative to sockets is Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which abstracts the 
communication interface to the level of a procedure call. Instead of working 
directly with sockets, the programmer has the illusion of calling a local 
procedure, when in fact the arguments of the call are packaged up and shipped 
off to the remote target of the call. RPC systems encode arguments and return 
values using an external data representation, such as XDR.
<p>RPC, however, does not translate well into distributed object systems, where 
communication between program-level <em>objects</em> residing in different address 
spaces is needed. In order to match the semantics of object invocation, 
distributed object systems require <em>remote method invocation</em> or RMI. In such 
systems, a local surrogate (stub) object manages the invocation on a remote 
object.
<p>The Java remote method invocation system described in this specification has 
been specifically designed to operate in the Java environment. While other RMI 
systems can be adapted to handle Java objects, these systems fall short of 
seamless integration with the Java system due to their interoperability 
requirement with other languages. For example, CORBA presumes a 
heterogeneous, multilanguage environment and thus must have a language-
neutral object model. In contrast, the Java language's RMI system assumes the 
homogeneous environment of the Java Virtual Machine, and the system can 
therefore take advantage of the Java object model whenever possible.
<p><h1><a name="215">
System Goals
</a></h1>The goals for supporting distributed objects in the Java language are:
<p><ul><li>Support seamless remote invocation on objects in different virtual machines.
<li>Support callbacks from servers to applets.
<li>Integrate the distributed object model into the Java language in a natural 
way while retaining most of the Java language's object semantics.
<li>Make differences between the distributed object model and local Java object 
model apparent.
<li>Make writing reliable distributed applications as simple as possible.
<li>Preserve the safety provided by the Java runtime environment.
</ul>Underlying all these goals is a general requirement that the RMI model be both 
simple (easy to use) and natural (fits well in the language).
<p>In addition, the RMI system should allow extensions such as garbage collection 
of remote objects, server replication, and the activation of persistent objects to 
service an invocation. These extensions should be transparent to the client and 
add minimal implementation requirements on the part of the servers that use 
them. To support these extensions, the system should also support:
<p><ul><li>Several invocation mechanisms; for example simple invocation to a single 
object or invocation to an object replicated at multiple locations. The system 
should also be extensible to other invocation paradigms.
<li>Various reference semantics for remote objects; for example live 
(nonpersistent) references, persistent references, and lazy activation. 
<li>The safe Java environment provided by security managers and class loaders.
<li>Distributed garbage collection of active objects.
<li>Capability of supporting multiple transports.
</ul>The first two chapters in this specification describe the distributed object model 
for the Java language and the system architecture. The remaining chapters 
describe the RMI client and server visible APIs which are part of JDK 1.1.
