Overview
</a></h1>The RMI system consists of three layers: the <em>stub/skeleton layer</em>, the <em>remote 
reference layer</em>, and the <em>transport layer</em>. The boundary at each layer is defined by 
a specific interface and protocol; each layer, therefore, is independent of the 
next and can be replaced by an alternate implementation without affecting the 
other layers in the system. For example, the current transport implementation 
is TCP-based (using Java sockets), but a transport based on UDP could be 
substituted.
<p>To accomplish transparent transmission of objects from one address space to 
another, the technique of object serialization (designed specifically for the Java 
language) is used. Object serialization is described in this chapter only with 
regard to its use for marshaling primitives and objects. For complete details, 
see the <em>Object Serialization Specification.
</em><p>Another technique, called <em>dynamic stub loading</em>, is used to support client-side 
stubs which implement the same set of remote interfaces as a remote object 
itself. This technique, used when a stub of the exact type is not already 
available to the client, allows a client to use the Java language's built-in 
operators for casting and type-checking.
<p><h1><a name="200">
Architectural Overview
</a></h1>The RMI system consists of three layers:
<p><ul><li>The stub/skeleton layer - client-side stubs (proxies) and server-side 
skeletons
<li>The remote reference layer - remote reference behavior (such as invocation 
to a single object or to a replicated object)
<li>The transport layer - connection set up and management and remote object 
tracking
</ul>The application layer sits on top of the RMI system. The relationship between 
the layers is shown in the following figure.
<p><a name="983">
 <center><img src="rmi-arch.doc.anc.gif"></center>
<p>
</a>A remote method invocation from a client to a remote server object travels 
down through the layers of the RMI system to the client-side transport, then 
up through the server-side transport to the server.
<p>A client invoking a method on a remote server object actually makes use of a 
<em>stub</em> or proxy for the remote object as a conduit to the remote object. A client-
held reference to a remote object is a reference to a local stub. This stub is an 
implementation of the remote interfaces of the remote object and forwards 
invocation requests to that server object via the remote reference layer. Stubs 
are generated using the rmic compiler.
<p>The <em>remote reference layer</em> is responsible for carrying out the semantics of the 
invocation. For example, the remote reference layer is responsible for 
determining whether the server is a single object or is a replicated object 
requiring communications with multiple locations. Each remote object 
implementation chooses its own remote reference semantics-whether the 
server is a single object or is a replicated object requiring communications with 
its replicas.
<p>Also handled by the remote reference layer are the reference semantics for the 
server. The remote reference layer, for example, abstracts the different ways of 
referring to objects that are implemented in (a) servers that are always running 
on some machine, and (b) servers that are run only when some method 
invocation is made on them (activation). At the layers above the remote 
reference layer, these differences are not seen.
<p>The <em>transport layer</em> is responsible for connection setup, connection management, 
and keeping track of and dispatching to remote objects (the targets of remote 
calls) residing in the transport's address space. 
<p>In order to dispatch to a remote object, the transport forwards the remote call 
up to the remote reference layer. The remote reference layer handles any 
server-side behavior that needs to occur before handing off the request to the 
server-side skeleton. The skeleton for a remote object makes an up call to the 
remote object implementation which carries out the actual method call.
<p>The return value of a call is sent back through the skeleton, remote reference 
layer, and transport on the server side, and then up through the transport, 
remote reference layer, and stub on the client side.
<p><h1><a name="240">
The Stub/Skeleton Layer
</a></h1>The stub/skeleton layer is the interface between the application layer and the 
rest of the RMI system. This layer does not deal with specifics of any transport, 
but transmits data to the remote reference layer via the abstraction of <em>marshal 
streams</em>. Marshal streams employ a mechanism called <em>object serialization</em> which 
enables Java objects to be transmitted between address spaces. Objects 
transmitted using the object serialization system are passed by copy to the 
remote address space, unless they are remote objects, in which case they are 
passed by reference.
<p>A <em>stub</em> for a remote object is the client-side proxy for the remote object. Such a 
stub implements all the interfaces that are supported by the remote object 
implementation. A client-side stub is responsible for:
<p><ul><li>Initiating a call to the remote object (by calling the remote reference layer).
<li>Marshaling arguments to a marshal stream (obtained from the remote 
reference layer).
<li>Informing the remote reference layer that the call should be invoked.
<li>Unmarshaling the return value or exception from a marshal stream.
<li>Informing the remote reference layer that the call is complete.
</ul>A <em>skeleton</em> for a remote object is a server-side entity that contains a method 
which dispatches calls to the actual remote object implementation. The 
skeleton is responsible for:
<p><ul><li>Unmarshaling arguments from the marshal stream.
<li>Making the up-call to the actual remote object implementation.
<li>Marshaling the return value of the call or an exception (if one occurred) onto 
the marshal stream.
</ul>The appropriate stub and skeleton classes are determined at run time and are 
dynamically loaded as needed, as described in <a href="rmi-arch.doc.html#280">Dynamic Class 
Loading</a>. Stubs and skeletons are generated using the rmic compiler.
<p><h1><a name="583">
The Remote Reference Layer
</a></h1>The remote reference layer deals with the lower-level transport interface. This 
layer is also responsible for carrying out a specific remote reference protocol 
which is independent of the client stubs and server skeletons.
<p>Each remote object implementation chooses its own remote reference subclass 
that operates on its behalf. Various invocation protocols can be carried out at 
this layer. Examples are:
<p><ul><li>Unicast point-to-point invocation.
<li>Invocation to replicated object groups.
<li>Support for a specific replication strategy.
<li>Support for a persistent reference to the remote object (enabling activation 
of the remote object).
<li>Reconnection strategies (if remote object becomes inaccessible).
</ul>The remote reference layer has two cooperating components: the client-side 
and the server-side components. The client-side component contains 
information specific to the remote server (or servers, if the remote reference is 
to a replicated object) and communicates via the transport to the server-side 
component. During each method invocation, the client and server-side 
components perform the specific remote reference semantics. For example, if a 
remote object is part of a replicated object, the client-side component can 
forward the invocation to each replica rather than just a single remote object.
<p>In a corresponding manner, the server-side component implements the specific 
remote reference semantics prior to delivering a remote method invocation to 
the skeleton. This component, for example, would handle ensuring atomic 
multicast delivery by communicating with other servers in a replica group 
(note that multicast delivery is not part of the JDK 1.1 release of RMI).
<p>The remote reference layer transmits data to the transport layer via the 
abstraction of a stream-oriented <em>connection</em>. The transport takes care of the 
implementation details of connections. Although connections present a 
streams-based interface, a connectionless transport can be implemented 
beneath the abstraction.
<p><h1><a name="264">
The Transport Layer
</a></h1>In general, the transport layer of the RMI system is responsible for:
<p><ul><li>Setting up connections to remote address spaces.
<li>Managing connections.
<li>Monitoring connection "liveness."
<li>Listening for incoming calls.
<li>Maintaining a table of remote objects that reside in the address space.
<li>Setting up a connection for an incoming call.
<li>Locating the dispatcher for the target of the remote call and passing the 
connection to this dispatcher.
</ul>The concrete representation of a remote object reference consists of an endpoint 
and an object identifier. This representation is called a <em>live reference</em>. Given a 
live reference for a remote object, a transport can use the endpoint to set up a 
connection to the address space in which the remote object resides. On the 
server side, the transport uses the object identifier to look up the target of the 
remote call.
<p>The transport for the RMI system consists of four basic abstractions:
<p><ul><li>An <em>endpoint</em> is the abstraction used to denote an address space or Java 
virtual machine. In the implementation, an endpoint can be mapped to its 
transport. That is, given an endpoint, a specific transport instance can be 
obtained.
<li>A <em>channel</em> is the abstraction for a conduit between two address spaces. As 
such, it is responsible for managing connections between the local address 
space and the remote address space for which it is a channel.
<li>A <em>connection</em> is the abstraction for transferring data (performing 
input/output).
<li>The <em>transport</em> abstraction manages channels. Each channel is a virtual 
connection between two address spaces. Within a transport, only one 
channel exists per pair of address spaces (the local address space and a 
remote address space). Given an endpoint to a remote address space, a 
transport sets up a channel to that address space. The transport abstraction 
is also responsible for accepting calls on incoming connections to the 
address space, setting up a connection object for the call, and dispatching to 
higher layers in the system.
</ul>A transport defines what the concrete representation of an endpoint is, so 
multiple transport implementations may exist. The design and implementation 
also supports multiple transports per address space, so both TCP and UDP can 
be supported in the same virtual machine. Note that the RMI transport 
interfaces are only available to the virtual machine implementation and are not 
available directly to the application.
<p><h1><a name="5112">
Thread Usage in Remote Method Invocations
</a></h1>A method dispatched by the RMI runtime to a remote object implementation (a 
server) may or may not execute in a separate thread. Some calls originating 
from the same client virtual machine will execute in the same thread; some will 
execute in different threads. Calls originating from different client virtual 
machines will execute in different threads. Other than this last case of different 
client virtual machines, the RMI runtime makes no guarantees with respect to 
mapping remote object invocations to threads.
<p><h1><a name="5097">
Garbage Collection of Remote Objects
</a></h1>In a distributed system, just as in the local system, it is desirable to 
automatically delete those remote objects that are no longer referenced by any 
client. This frees the programmer from needing to keep track of the remote 
objects	 clients so that it can terminate appropriately. RMI uses a reference-
counting garbage collection algorithm similar to Modula-3's Network Objects. 
(See "Network Objects" by Birrell, Nelson, and Owicki, <em>Digital Equipment 
Corporation Systems Research Center Technical Report 11</em>5, 1994.)
<p>To accomplish reference-counting garbage collection, the RMI runtime keeps 
track of all live references within each Java virtual machine. When a live 
reference enters a Java virtual machine, its reference count is incremented. The 
first reference to an object sends a "referenced" message to the server for the 
object. As live references are found to be unreferenced in the local virtual 
machine, their finalization decrements the count. When the last reference has 
been discarded, an unreferenced message is sent to the server. Many subtleties 
exist in the protocol; most of these are related to maintaining the ordering of 
referenced and unreferenced messages in order to ensure that the object is not 
prematurely collected.
<p>When a remote object is not referenced by any client, the RMI runtime refers to 
it using a weak reference. The weak reference allows the Java virtual machine's 
garbage collector to discard the object if no other local references to the object 
exist. The distributed garbage collection algorithm interacts with the local Java 
virtual machine's garbage collector in the usual ways by holding normal or 
weak references to objects. As in the normal object life-cycle <code>finalize</code> will be 
called after the garbage collector determines that no more references to the 
object exist.
<p>As long as a local reference to a remote object exists, it cannot be garbage-
collected and it can be passed in remote calls or returned to clients. Passing a 
remote object adds the identifier for the virtual machine to which it was passed 
to the referenced set. A remote object needing unreferenced notification must 
implement the <code>java.rmi.server.Unreferenced</code> interface. When those 
references no longer exist, the <code>unreferenced</code> method will be invoked. 
<code>unreferenced</code> is called when the set of references is found to be empty so it 
might be called more than once. Remote objects are only collected when no 
more references, either local or remote, still exist.
<p>Note that if a network partition exists between a client and a remote server 
object, it is possible that premature collection of the remote object will occur 
(since the transport might believe that the client crashed). Because of the 
possibility of premature collection, remote references cannot guarantee 
referential integrity; in other words, it is always possible that a remote 
reference may in fact not refer to an existing object. An attempt to use such a 
reference will generate a <code>RemoteException</code> which must be handled by the 
application.
<p><h1><a name="280">
Dynamic Class Loading
</a></h1>In RPC (remote procedure call) systems, client-side stub code must be 
generated and linked into a client before a remote procedure call can be done. 
This code can be either statically linked into the client or linked in at runtime 
via dynamic linking with libraries available locally or over a network file 
system. In the case of either static or dynamic linking, the specific code to 
handle an RPC must be available to the client machine in compiled form.
<p>RMI generalizes this technique, using a mechanism called dynamic class 
loading to load at runtime (in the Java language's architecture neutral bytecode 
format) the classes required to handle method invocations on a remote object. 
These classes are:
<p><ul><li>The classes of remote objects and their interfaces.
<li>The stub and skeleton classes that serve as proxies for remote objects. (Stubs 
and skeletons are created using the <code>rmic</code> compiler.)
<li>Other classes used directly in an RMI-based application, such as parameters 
to, or return values from, remote method invocations. 
</ul>This section describes:
<p><ul><li>How the RMI runtime chooses a class loader and the location from which to 
load classes.
<li>How to force the downloading over the net of all the classes for a Java 
application.
</ul>In addition to class loaders, dynamic class loading employs two other 
mechanisms: the object serialization system to transmit classes over the wire, 
and a security manager to check the classes that are loaded. The object 
serialization system is discussed in the <em>Object Serialization Specification</em>. Security 
issues are discussed in <a href="rmi-arch.doc.html#4041">Security</a>.
<p><h2><a name="3932">
How a Class Loader is Chosen
</a></h2>In Java, the class loader that initially loads a Java class is subsequently used to 
load all the interfaces and classes that are used directly in the class:
<p><ul><li>The AppletClassLoader is used to download a Java applet over the net from 
the location specified by the codebase attribute on the web page that 
contains the &lt;applet&gt; tag. All classes used directly in the applet are 
subsequently loaded by the AppletClassLoader.
<li>The default class loader is used to load a class (whose <code>main</code> method is run 
by using the <code>java</code> command) from the local CLASSPATH. All classes used 
directly in that class are subsequently loaded by the default class loader 
from the local CLASSPATH.
<li>The RMIClassLoader is used to load those classes not directly used by the 
client or server application: the stubs and skeletons of remote objects, and 
extended classes of arguments and return values to RMI calls. The 
RMIClassLoader looks for these classes in the following locations, in the 
order listed:
<ol>
<li>The local CLASSPATH. Classes are always loaded locally if they exist 
locally.
<li>For objects (both remote and nonremote) passed as parameters or return 
values, the URL encoded in the marshal stream that contains the 
serialized object is used to locate the class for the object.
<li>For stubs and skeletons of remote objects created in the local virtual 
machine, the URL specified by the local <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> 
property is used.
</ol>
</ul>For objects passed as parameters or return values (the second case above), the 
URL that is encoded in the stream for an object's class is determined as 
follows:
<p><ul><li>If the class was loaded by a class loader (other than the default classloader), 
the URL of that class loader is used.
<li>otherwise, if defined, the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> URL is used.
</ul> Thus, if a class was loaded from CLASSPATH, the codebase URL will be used 
to annotate that class in the stream if that class is used in an RMI call.
<p>The application can be configured with the property 
<code>java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly</code>, which disables the loading of classes 
from network hosts and forces classes to be loaded only from the locally 
defined codebase. If the required class cannot be loaded, the method 
invocation will fail with an exception.
<p><h2><a name="3933">
Bootstrapping the Client
</a></h2>For the RMI runtime to be able to download <em>all</em> the classes and interfaces 
needed by a client application, a bootstrapping client program is required 
which forces the use of a class loader (such as RMI's class loader) instead of the 
default class loader. The bootstrapping program needs to:
<p><ul><li>Create an instance of the <code>RMISecurityManager</code> or user-defined security 
manager.
<li>Use the method <code>RMIClassLoader.loadClass</code> to load the class file for the 
client. The class name cannot be mentioned explicitly in the code, but must 
instead be a string or a command line argument. Otherwise, the default 
class loader will try to load the client class file from the local CLASSPATH.
<li>Use the <code>newInstance</code> method to create an instance of the client and cast it 
to <code>Runnable</code>. Thus, the client must implement the <code>java.lang.Runnable</code> 
interface. The <code>Runnable</code> interface provides a well-defined interface for 
starting a thread of execution.
<li>Start the client by calling the <code>run</code> method (of the <code>Runnable</code> interface).
</ul>For example:
<p><dl><a name="3363"><pre>import java.rmi.RMISecurityManager;
import java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader;

public class LoadClient
{
	public static void main()
	{
		System.setSecurityManager(new RMISecurityManager());
</pre></a><a name="5052"><pre>		try {
			Class cl = RMIClassLoader.loadClass("myclient");
			Runnable client = (Runnable)cl.newInstance();
			client.run();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Exception: " + e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
</pre></a></dl>In order for this code to work, you need to specify the java.rmi.server.codebase 
property when you run the bootstrapping program so that the <code>loadClass</code> 
method will use this URL to load the class. For example:
<p><dl><a name="3459"><pre>java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://host/rmiclasses/ LoadClient
</pre></a></dl>Instead of relying on the property, you can supply your own URL:
<p><dl><a name="5178"><pre>Class cl = RMIClassLoader.loadClass(url, "myclient");
</pre></a></dl>Once the client is started and has control, all classes needed by the client will 
be loaded from the specified URL. This bootstrapping technique is exactly the 
same technique Java uses to force the AppletClassLoader to download the 
same classes used in an applet.
<p>Without this bootstrapping technique, all the classes directly referenced in the 
client code must be available through the local CLASSPATH on the client, and 
the only Java classes that can be loaded by the RMIClassLoader over the net 
are classes that are not referred to directly in the client program; these classes 
are stubs, skeletons, and the extended classes of arguments and return values 
to remote method invocations.
<p><h1><a name="4041">
Security
</a></h1>In Java, when a class loader loads classes from the local CLASSPATH, those 
classes are considered trustworthy and are not restricted by a security 
manager. However, when the RMIClassLoader attempts to load classes from 
the network, there must be a security manager in place or an exception is 
thrown.
<p>The security manger must be started as the first action of a Java program so 
that it can regulate subsequent actions. The security manager ensures that 
loaded classes adhere to the standard Java safety guarantees, for example that 
classes are loaded from "trusted" sources (such as the applet host) and do not 
attempt to access sensitive functions. A complete description of the restrictions 
imposed by security managers can be found in the documentation for the 
<code>AppletSecurity</code> class and the <code>RMISecurityManager</code> class. 
<p>Applets are always subject to the restrictions imposed by the 
<code>AppletSecurity</code> class. This security manager ensures that classes are loaded 
only from the applet host or its designated codebase hosts. This requires that 
applet developers install the appropriate classes on the applet host.
<p>Applications must either define their own security manager or use the 
restrictive <code>RMISecurityManager</code>. If no security manager is in place, an 
application cannot load classes from network sources.
<p>A client or server program is usually implemented by classes loaded from the 
local system and therefore is not subject to the restrictions of the security 
manager. If however, the client program itself is downloaded from the network 
using the technique described in <a href="rmi-arch.doc.html#3933">Bootstrapping the Client</a>, then 
the client program is subject to the restrictions of the security manager.
<p><em>Once a class is loaded by the RMIClassLoader, any classes used directly 
by that class are also loaded by the RMIClassLoader and thus are subject to the 
security manager restrictions.
</em><p>Even if a security manager is in place, setting the property 
<code>java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly</code> to true prevents the downloading of 
a class from the URL embedded in the stream with a serialized object (classes 
can still be loaded from the locally-defined <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code>). 
The <code>java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly</code> property can be specified on 
both the client and the server, but is not applicable for applets.
<p>If an application defines its own security manager which disallows the creation 
of a class loader, classes will be loaded using the default <code>Class.forName</code> 
mechanism. Thus, a server may define its own policies via the security 
manager and class loader, and the RMI system will operate within those 
policies.
<p><em>The<code> java.lang.SecurityManager</code> abstract class, from which all 
security managers are extended, does not regulate resource consumption. 
Therefore, the current <code>RMISecurityManager</code> has no mechanisms available to 
prevent classes loaded from abusing resources. As new security manager 
mechanisms are developed, RMI will use them.
</em><p><h1><a name="4018">
Configuration Scenarios
</a></h1>The RMI system supports many different scenarios. Servers can be configured 
in an open or closed fashion. Applets can use RMI to invoke methods on 
objects supported on servers. If an applet creates and passes a remote object to 
the server, the server can use RMI to make a callback to the remote object. Java 
applications can use RMI either in client-server mode or from peer to peer. This 
section highlights the issues surrounding these configurations. 
<p><h2><a name="4033">
Servers
</a></h2>The typical closed-system scenario has the server configured to load no classes. 
The services it provides are defined by remote interfaces that are all local to the 
server machine. The server has no security manager and will not load classes 
even if clients send along the URL. If clients send remote objects for which the 
server does not have stub classes, those method invocations will fail when the 
request is unmarshaled, and the client will receive an exception.
<p>The more open server system will define its <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> so 
that classes for the remote objects it exports can be loaded by clients, and so 
that the server can load classes when needed for remote objects supplied by 
clients. The server will have both a security manager and RMI class loader 
which protect the server. A somewhat more cautious server can use the 
property <code>java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly</code> to disable the loading of 
classes from client-supplied URLs.
<p><h2><a name="4063">
Applets
</a></h2>Typically, the classes needed will be supplied by an HTTP server or by an FTP 
server as referenced in URL's embedded in the HTML page containing the 
applet. The RMI-based service(s) used by the applet must be on the server 
from which the applet was downloaded, because an applet can only make 
network connections to the host from which it was loaded.
<p>For example, the normal applet scenario uses a single host for the HTTP server 
providing the HTML page, the applet code, the RMI services, and the 
bootstrap Registry. In this scenario, all the stub, skeleton, and supporting 
classes are loaded from the HTTP server. All of the remote objects provided by 
the RMI service and passed to the applet (which may pass them back to the 
server) will be for classes that the RMI service already knows about. In this 
case, the RMI service is very secure because it loads no classes from the 
network.
<p><h2><a name="1564">
Applications
</a></h2>Applications written in the Java language, unlike applets, can connect to any 
host; so Java applications have more options for configuring the sources of 
classes and where RMI based services run. Typically, a single HTTP server will 
be used to supply remote classes, while the RMI-based applications themselves 
are distributed around the network on servers or running on user's desktops
<p>If an application is loaded locally, then the classes used directly in that 
program must also be available locally. In this scenario, the only classes that 
can be downloaded from a network source are the classes of remote interfaces, 
stub classes, and the extended classes of arguments and return values to 
remote method invocations. 
<p>If an application is not loaded from a local directory, but is loaded from a 
network source using the bootstrapping mechanism described in <a href="rmi-arch.doc.html#3933">Bootstrapping the Client</a>, then all classes used by the application can be 
downloaded from the same network source.
<p>To enable downloading from a network source, each remote object server must 
be configured with the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property which 
specifies where application classes and generated stubs/skeletons reside. 
When the codebase property is specified, the RMI system embeds the URL of a 
class in the serialized form of the class.
<p>Even if a serialized object's class is annotated with the URL from which the 
class can be downloaded, a client or peer will still load classes locally if they 
are available.
<p><h1><a name="4799">
RMI Through Firewalls Via Proxies
</a></h1>The RMI transport layer normally attempts to open direct sockets to hosts on 
the Internet. Many intranets, however, have firewalls which do not allow this. 
The default RMI transport, therefore, provides two alternate HTTP-based 
mechanisms which enable a client behind a firewall to invoke a method on a 
remote object which resides outside the firewall.
<p><h2><a name="3750">
How an RMI Call is Packaged within the HTTP Protocol
</a></h2>To get outside a firewall, the transport layer embeds an RMI call within the 
firewall-trusted HTTP protocol. The RMI call data is sent outside as the body 
of an HTTP POST request, and the return information is sent back in the body 
of the HTTP response. The transport layer will formulate the POST request in 
one of two ways:
<p><ol>
<li>If the firewall proxy will forward an HTTP request directed to an arbitrary 
port on the host machine, then it is forwarded directly to the port on which 
the RMI server is listening. The default RMI transport layer on the target 
machine is listening with a server socket that is capable of understanding 
and decoding RMI calls inside POST requests.
<li>If the firewall proxy will only forward HTTP requests directed to certain 
well-known HTTP ports, then the call will be forwarded to the HTTP server 
listening on port 80 of the host machine, and a CGI script will be executed to 
forward the call to the target RMI server port on the same machine.
</ol>
<h2><a name="3754">
The Default Socket Factory
</a></h2>The RMI transport extends the <code>java.rmi.server.RMISocketFactory</code> class 
to provide a default implementation of a socket factory which is the resource-
provider for client and server sockets. This default socket factory creates 
sockets that transparently provide the firewall tunnelling mechanism as 
follows:
<p><ul><li>Client sockets automatically attempt HTTP connections to hosts that cannot 
be contacted with a direct socket.
<li>Server sockets automatically detect if a newly-accepted connection is an 
HTTP POST request, and if so, return a socket that will expose only the 
body of the request to the transport and format its output as an HTTP 
response.
</ul>Client-side sockets, with this default behavior, are provided by the factory's 
<code>java.rmi.server.RMISocketFactory.createSocket</code> method. Server-
side sockets with this default behavior are provided by the factory's 
<code>java.rmi.server.RMISocketFactory.createServerSocket</code> method.

Configuring the Client
</a></h2>There is no special configuration necessary to enable the client to send RMI 
calls through a firewall.
<p>The client can, however, disable the packaging of RMI calls as HTTP requests 
by setting the <code>java.rmi.server.disableHttp</code> property to equal the 
boolean value true.
<p><h2><a name="3762">
Configuring the Server
</a></h2><em>The host name should not be specified as the host's IP address, because 
some firewall proxies will not forward to such a host name.
</em><p><ol>
<li>In order for a client outside the server host's domain to be able to invoke 
methods on a server's remote objects, the client must be able to find the 
server. To do this, the remote references that the server exports must contain 
the fully-qualified name of the server host.
<a name="3764">
Depending on the server's platform and network environment, this 
information may or may not be available to the Java virtual machine on 
which the server is running. If it is not available, the host's fully qualified 
name must be specified with the property <code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> 
when starting the server.
<p>
</a><a name="3765">
For example, use this command to start the RMI server class <code>ServerImpl</code> 
on the machine chatsubo.javasoft.com:
<p>
</a><dl><a name="3766"><pre>   java -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=chatsubo.javasoft.com ServerImpl
</pre></a></dl><li>If the server will not support RMI clients behind firewalls that can forward 
to arbitrary ports, use this configuration:
<ol>
<li>An HTTP server is listening on port 80.
<li>A CGI script is located at the aliased URL path <code>/cgi-bin/java-rmi</code>. 
This script:
<ul>
<li>Invokes the local Java interpreter to execute a class internal to the 
transport layer which forwards the request to the appropriate RMI 
server port.
<li>Defines properties in the Java virtual machine with the same names 
and values as the CGI 1.0 defined environment variables.
<a name="3773">
An example script is supplied in the RMI distribution for the Solaris and 
Windows 32 operating systems. Note that the script must specify the 
complete path to the java interpreter on the server machine.
<p>
</a></ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2><a name="3774">
Performance Issues and Limitations
</a></h2>Calls transmitted via HTTP requests are at least an order of magnitude slower 
that those sent through direct sockets, without taking proxy forwarding delays 
into consideration.
<p>Because HTTP requests can only be initiated in one direction through a 
firewall, a client cannot export its own remote objects outside the firewall, 
because a host outside the firewall cannot initiate a method invocation back on 
the client.
