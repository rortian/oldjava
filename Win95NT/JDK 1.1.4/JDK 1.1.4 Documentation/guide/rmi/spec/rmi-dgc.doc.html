</ul><h1><a name="6449">
The Interface DGC
</a></h1>The DGC abstraction is used for the server side of the distributed garbage 
collection algorithm. This interface contains the two methods: <code>dirty</code> and 
<code>clean</code>. A <code>dirty</code> call is made when a remote reference is unmarshaled in a 
client (the client is indicated by its <code>VMID</code>). A corresponding clean call is made 
when no more references to the remote reference exist in the client. A failed 
dirty call must schedule a strong clean call so that the call's sequence number 
can be retained in order to detect future calls received out of order by the 
distributed garbage collector.
<p>A reference to a remote object is <em>leased</em> for a period of time by the client holding 
the reference. The lease period starts when the dirty call is received. It is the 
client's responsibility to renew the leases, by making additional <code>dirty</code> calls, 
on the remote references it holds before such leases expire. If the client does 
not renew the lease before it expires, the distributed garbage collector assumes 
that the remote object is no longer referenced by that client.
<p><dl><a name="6480"><pre>package java.rmi.dgc;
import java.rmi.server.ObjID;

public interface DGC extends java.rmi.Remote {

	Lease dirty(ObjID[] ids, long sequenceNum, Lease lease)
		throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
	
	void clean(ObjID[] ids, long seqNum, VMID vmid, boolean strong)
		throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}
</pre></a></dl>The method <code>dirty</code> requests leases for the remote object references associated 
with the object identifiers contained in the array argument ids. The lease 
contains a client's unique virtual machine identifier (VMID) and a requested 
lease period. For each remote object exported in the local virtual machine, the 
garbage collector maintains a <em>reference list </em>- a list of clients that hold 
references to it. If the lease is granted, the garbage collector adds the client's 
VMID to the reference list for each remote object indicated in ids. The 
sequenceNum parameter is a sequence number that is used to detect and discard 
late calls to the garbage collector. The sequence number should always increase 
for each subsequent call to the garbage collector.
<p>Some clients are unable to generate a unique VMID. This is because a VMID is 
a universally unique identifier only if it contains a <em>true</em> host address, an 
address which some clients are unable to obtain due to security restrictions. In 
this case, a client can use a VMID of <code>null</code>, and the distributed garbage 
collector will assign a VMID for the client.
<p>The <code>dirty</code> call returns a <code>Lease</code> object that contains the VMID used and the 
lease period granted for the remote references. (A server can decide to grant a 
smaller lease period than the client requests.) A client must use the VMID the 
garbage collector uses in order to make corresponding <code>clean</code> calls when the 
client drops remote object references.
<p>A client virtual machine need only make one initial <code>dirty</code> call for each remote 
reference referenced in the virtual machine (even if it has multiple references to 
the same remote object). The client must also make a <code>dirty</code> call to renew 
leases on remote references before such leases expire. When the client no 
longer has any references to a specific remote object, it must schedule a <code>clean</code> 
call for the object ID associated with the reference.
<p>The <code>clean</code> call removes the vmid from the reference list of each remote object 
indicated in ids. The sequence number is used to detect late clean calls. If the 
argument strong is true, then the clean call is a result of a failed <code>dirty</code> call, and 
the sequence number for the client vmid therefore needs to be remembered.
<p><h1><a name="6770">
The Lease Class
</a></h1>A lease contains a unique virtual machine identifier and a lease duration. A 
<code>Lease</code> object is used to request and grant leases to remote object references.
<p><dl><a name="6934"><pre>package java.rmi.dgc;

public final class Lease implements java.io.Serializable {

	public Lease(VMID id, long duration);

	public VMID getVMID();

	public long getValue();
}
</pre></a></dl>The <code>Lease</code> constructor creates a lease with a specific VMID and lease duration. 
The VMID may be <code>null</code>.
<p>The <code>getVMID</code> method returns the client VMID associated with the lease.
<p>The <code>getValue</code> method returns the lease duration.
<p><h1><a name="7144">
The ObjID Class
</a></h1>The class <code>ObjID</code> is used to identify remote objects uniquely in a virtual 
machine over time. Each identifier contains an object number and an address 
space identifier that is unique with respect to a specific host. An object 
identifier is assigned to a remote object when it is exported.
<p>An <code>ObjID</code> consists of an object number (a <code>long</code>) and a unique identifier for the 
address space (a <code>UID</code>).
<p><dl><a name="6752"><pre>package java.rmi.server;

public final class ObjID implements java.io.Serializable {

	public ObjID ();

	public ObjID (int num);

	public void write(ObjectOutput out) throws java.io.IOException;

	public static ObjID read(ObjectInput in)
		throws java.io.IOException;

	public int hashCode() 

	public boolean equals(Object obj) 

	public String toString()
}
</pre></a></dl>The first form of the <code>ObjID</code> constructor generates a unique object identifier. 
The second constructor generates <em>well-known</em> object identifiers (such as those 
used by the registry and the distributed garbage collector) and takes as an 
argument a well-known object number. A well-known object ID generated via 
this second constructor will not clash with any object IDs generated via the 
default constructor; to enforce this, the object number of the <code>ObjID</code> is set to the 
"well-known" number supplied in the constructor and all <code>UID</code> fields are set to 
zero.
<p>The method <code>write</code> marshals the object ID's representation to an output 
stream. 
<p>The method <code>read</code> constructs an object ID whose contents is read from the 
specified input stream.
<p>The method <code>hashCode</code> returns the object number as the hashcode
<p>The <code>equals</code> method returns true if obj is an <code>ObjID</code> with the same contents.
<p>The <code>toString</code> method returns a string containing the object ID representation. 
The address space identifier is included in the string representation only if the 
object ID is from a non-local address space.
<p><h1><a name="6758">
The UID Class
</a></h1>The class <code>UID</code> is an abstraction for creating identifiers that are unique with 
respect to the host on which it is generated. A <code>UID</code> is contained in an <code>ObjID</code> as 
an address space identifier. A UID consists of a number that is unique on the 
host (an <code>int</code>), a time (a <code>long</code>), and a count (a <code>short</code>).
<p><dl><a name="6760"><pre>package java.rmi.server;

public final class UID implements java.io.Serializable {

    public UID();

    public UID(short num); 

    public int hashCode();

    public boolean equals(Object obj);

    public String toString();

    public void write(DataOutput out) throws java.io.IOException;

    public static UID read(DataInput in) throws java.io.IOException;
}
</pre></a></dl>The first form of the constructor creates a pure identifier that is unique with 
respect to the host on which it is generated. This <code>UID</code> is unique under the 
following conditions: a) the machine takes more than one second to reboot, and 
b) the machine's clock is never set backward. In order to construct a <code>UID</code> that is 
globally unique, simply pair a <code>UID</code> with an <code>InetAddress</code>.
<p>The second form of the constructor creates a <em>well-known</em> <code>UID</code>. There are 216 -1 
such possible well-known IDs. An ID generated via this constructor will not 
clash with any ID generated via the default <code>UID</code> constructor which generates a 
genuinely unique identifier with respect to this host.
<p>The methods <code>hashCode</code>, <code>equals</code>, and <code>toString</code> are defined for UIDs. Two 
UIDs are considered equal if they have the same contents.
<p>The method <code>write</code> writes the UID to the output stream.
<p>The method <code>read</code> constructs a UID whose contents is read from the specified 
input stream. 
<p><h1><a name="6613">
The VMID Class
</a></h1>The class <code>VMID</code> provides a universally unique identifier among all Java virtual 
machines. A <code>VMID</code> contains a <code>UID</code> and a host address. A <code>VMID</code> can be used to 
identify client virtual machines.
<p><dl><a name="6617"><pre>package java.rmi.dgc;

public final class VMID implements java.io.Serializable {

	public VMID();

	public static boolean isUnique();

	public int hashCode();

	public boolean equals(Object obj);
	
	public String toString();
}
</pre></a></dl>The <code>VMID</code> default constructor creates a globally unique identifier among all 
Java virtual machines under the following conditions:
<p><ul><li>the conditions for uniqueness for objects of the class 
<code>java.rmi.server.UID</code> are satisfied, and
<li> an address can be obtained for the host that is unique and constant for the 
lifetime of the <code>UID</code> object.
</ul>A <code>VMID</code> contains the host address of the machine on which it was created. Due 
to security restrictions, obtaining the true host address is not always possible 
(for example, the loopback host may be used under security-restricted 
conditions). The method <code>isUnique</code> can be called to determine if <code>VMIDs</code> 
generated in this virtual machine are, in fact, unique among all virtual 
machines. The method <code>isUnique</code> returns true if a valid host name can be 
determined (other than loopback host); otherwise it returns false.
<p>The <code>hashCode</code>, <code>equals</code> and <code>toString</code> methods are defined for <code>VMID</code>s. Two 
VMIDs are considered equal if they have the same contents.
