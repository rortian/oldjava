Definition of Terms
</a></h1>In the Java distributed object model, a <em>remote object</em> is one whose methods can 
be invoked from another Java Virtual Machine, potentially on a different host. 
An object of this type is described by one or more <em>remote interfaces</em>, which are 
Java interfaces that declare the methods of the remote object. 
<p><em>Remote method invocation</em> (RMI) is the action of invoking a method of a remote 
interface on a remote object. Most importantly, a method invocation on a 
remote object has the same syntax as a method invocation on a local object.
<p><h1><a name="182">
The Distributed and Nondistributed Models Contrasted
</a></h1>The Java distributed object model is similar to the Java object model in the 
following ways:
<p><ul><li>A reference to a remote object can be passed as an argument or returned as 
a result in any method invocation (local or remote).
<li>A remote object can be cast to any of the set of remote interfaces supported 
by the implementation using the built-in Java syntax for casting.
<li>The built-in Java <code>instanceof</code> operator can be used to test the remote 
interfaces supported by a remote object.
</ul>The Java distributed object model differs from the Java object model in these 
ways:
<p><ul><li>Clients of remote objects interact with remote interfaces, never with the 
implementation classes of those interfaces.
<li>Nonremote arguments to, and results from, a remote method invocation are 
passed by copy rather than by reference. This is because references to objects 
are only useful within a single virtual machine.
<li>A remote object is passed by reference, not by copying the actual remote 
implementation.
<li>The semantics of some of the methods defined by class <code>Object</code> are 
specialized for remote objects.
<li>Since the failure modes of invoking remote objects are inherently more 
complicated than the failure modes of invoking local objects, clients must 
deal with additional exceptions that can occur during a remote method 
invocation.
</ul><h1><a name="213">
RMI Interfaces and Classes
</a></h1>The interfaces and classes that are responsible for specifying the remote 
behavior of the RMI system are defined in the <code>java.rmi</code> and the 
<code>java.rmi.server</code> packages. The following figure shows the relationship 
between these interfaces and classes:
<p><a name="1646">
 <img src="rmi-objmodel.doc.anc.gif">
<p>
</a><h2><a name="3459">
The Remote Interface
</a></h2>All remote interfaces extend, either directly or indirectly, the interface 
<code>java.rmi.remote</code>. The <code>Remote</code> interface defines no methods, as shown here:
<p><dl><a name="3460"><pre>public interface Remote {}
</pre></a></dl>For example, the following code fragment defines a remote interface for a bank 
account that contains methods that deposit to the account, get the account 
balance, and withdraw from the account:
<p><dl><a name="3561"><pre>public interface BankAccount
       extends Remote
{
	public void deposit (float amount)
		throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
	public void withdraw (float amount)
		throws OverdrawnException, java.rmi.RemoteException;
	public float balance()
		throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}
</pre></a></dl>The methods in a remote interface must be defined as follows:
<p><ul><li>Each method must declare <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code> in its throws 
clause, in addition to any application-specific exceptions.
<li>A remote object passed as an argument or return value (either directly or 
embedded within a local object) must be declared as the remote interface, 
not the implementation class.
</ul><h2><a name="3569">
The RemoteException Class
</a></h2>The <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code> class is the superclass of all exceptions 
that can be thrown by the RMI runtime. To ensure the robustness of 
applications using the RMI system, each method declared in a remote interface 
must specify <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code> in its throws clause.
<p><code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code> is thrown when a remote method invocation 
fails (for example when the network fails or the server for the call cannot be 
reached). This allows the application making the remote invocation to 
determine how best to deal with the remote exception. 
<p><h2><a name="1800">
The RemoteObject Class and its Subclasses
</a></h2>RMI server functions are provided by <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> 
and its subclasses, <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteServer</code> and 
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>:
<p><ul><li>The <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> class provides the remote 
semantics of <code>Object</code> by implementing methods for <code>hashCode</code>, <code>equals</code>, 
and <code>toString</code>.
<li>The functions needed to create objects and export them (make them 
available remotely) are provided abstractly by 
<code>java.rmi.server.RemoteServer</code> and concretely by its subclass(es). The 
subclass identifies the semantics of the remote reference, for example 
whether the server is a single object or is a replicated object requiring 
communications with multiple locations.
<li>The <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code> class defines a singleton 
(unicast) remote object whose references are valid only while the server 
process is alive.
</ul><h1><a name="1830">
Implementing a Remote Interface
</a></h1>The general rules for a class that implements a remote interface are as follows:
<p><ul><li>The class usually extends <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>, 
thereby inheriting the remote behavior provided by the classes 
<code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> and 
<code>java.rmi.server.RemoteServer</code>.
<li>The class can implement any number of remote interfaces.
<li>The class can extend another remote implementation class.
<li>The class can define methods that do not appear in the remote interface, but 
those methods can only be used locally and are not available remotely.
</ul>For example, the following code fragment defines the <code>BankAcctImpl</code> class, 
which implements the <code>BankAccount</code> remote interface and which extends the 
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code> class:
<p><dl><a name="3595"><pre>package my_package;

import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class BankAccountImpl
	extends UnicastRemoteObject
	implements BankAccount
{
	public void deposit (float amount) throws RemoteException {
		...
	}
	public void withdraw (float amount) throws OverdrawnException,
		RemoteException {
		...
	}
	public float balance() throws RemoteException {
		...
	}
}
</pre></a></dl>Note that if necessary, a class that implements a remote interface can extend 
some other class besides <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>. 
However, the implementation class must then assume the responsibility for the 
correct remote semantics of the <code>hashCode</code>, <code>equals</code>, and <code>toString</code> methods 
inherited from the <code>Object</code> class.
<p><h1><a name="307">
Type Equivalency of Remote Objects with Local Stub
</a></h1>In the distributed object model, clients interact with stub (surrogate) objects 
that have <em>exactly</em> the same set of remote interfaces defined by the remote 
object's class; the stub class does not include the nonremote portions of the 
class hierarchy that constitutes the object's type graph. This is because the stub 
class is generated from the most refined implementation class that implements 
one or more remote interfaces. For example, if C extends B and B extends A, 
but only B implements a remote interface, then a stub is generated from B, not 
C.
<p>Because the stub implements the same set of remote interfaces as the remote 
object's class, the stub has, from the point of view of the Java system, the same 
type as the remote portions of the server object's type graph. A client, 
therefore, can make use of the built-in Java operations to check a remote 
object's type and to cast from one remote interface to another.
<p>Stubs are generated using the rmic compiler.
<p><h1><a name="2521">
Parameter Passing in Remote Method Invocation
</a></h1>An argument to, or a return value from, a remote object can be any Java type 
that is <em>serializable</em>. This includes Java primitive types, remote Java objects, and 
nonremote Java objects that implement the <code>java.io.Serializable</code> 
interface. For more details on how to make classes serializable, see the Java 
"Object Serialization Specification." For applets, if the class of an argument or 
return value is not available locally, it is loaded dynamically via the 
AppletClassLoader. For applications, these classes are loaded by the class 
loader that loaded the application; this is either the default class loader (which 
uses the local class path) or the RMIClassLoader (which uses the server's 
codebase).
<p>Some classes may disallow their being passed (by not being serializable), for 
example for security reasons. In this case the remote method invocation will 
fail with an exception.
<p><h2><a name="2523">
Passing Nonremote Objects
</a></h2>A nonremote object, that is passed as a parameter of a remote method 
invocation or returned as a result of a remote method invocation, is passed by 
<em>copy</em>.
<p>That is, when a nonremote object appears in a remote method invocation, the 
content of the nonremote object is copied before invoking the call on the 
remote object. By default, only the nonstatic and nontransient fields are copied.
<p>Similarly, when a nonremote object is returned from a remote method 
invocation, a new object is created in the calling virtual machine.
<p><h2><a name="3404">
Passing Remote Objects
</a></h2>When passing a remote object as a parameter, the stub for the remote object is 
passed. A remote object passed as a parameter can only implement remote 
interfaces.
<p><h1><a name="315">
Exception Handling in Remote Method Invocation
</a></h1>Since remote methods include <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code> in their 
signature, the caller must be prepared to handle those exceptions in addition to 
other application specific exceptions. When a <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code> 
is thrown during a remote method invocation, the client may have little or no 
information on the outcome of the call - whether a failure happened before, 
during, or after the call completed. Therefore, remote interfaces and the calling 
methods declared in those interfaces should be designed with these failure 
semantics in mind.
<p><h1><a name="3734">
Object Methods Overridden by the RemoteObject Class
</a></h1>The default implementations in the <code>Object</code> class for the <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>, 
and <code>toString</code> methods are not appropriate for remote objects. Therefore, the 
<code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> class provides implementations for these 
methods that have semantics more appropriate for remote objects. In this way, 
all objects that need to be available remotely can extend 
<code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> (typically indirectly via 
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>).
<p><h2><a name="2475">
equals and hashCode
</a></h2>In order for a remote object to be used as a key in a hash table, the methods 
<code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> are overridden by the 
<code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> class:
<p><ul><li>The <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> class's implementation of the 
<code>equals</code> method determines whether two object references are equal, not 
whether the contents of the two objects are equal. This is because 
determining equality based on content requires a remote method invocation, 
and the signature of <code>equals</code> does not allow a remote exception to be 
thrown.
<li>The <code>java.rmi.server.RemoteObject</code> class's implementation of the 
<code>hashCode</code> method returns the same value for all remote references that 
refer to the same underlying remote object (because references to the same 
object are considered equal).
</ul><h2><a name="2478">
toString
</a></h2>The <code>toString</code> method is defined to return a string which represents the 
reference of the object. The contents of the string is specific to the reference 
type. The current implementation for singleton (unicast) objects includes 
information about the object specific to the transport layer (such as host name 
and port number) and an object identifier; references to replicated objects 
would contain more information.
<p><h2><a name="2480">
clone
</a></h2>Objects are only cloneable using the Java language's default mechanism if they 
support the <code>java.lang.Cloneable</code> interface. Remote objects do not 
implement this interface, but do implement the <code>clone</code> method so that if 
subclasses need to implement <code>Cloneable</code> the remote classes will function 
correctly.
<p>Client stubs are declared final and do not implement <code>clone</code>. Cloning a stub is 
therefore a local operation and cannot be used by clients to create a new 
remote object.
<p><h2><a name="2485">
finalize
</a></h2>Remote object implementations (subclasses of <code>RemoteObject</code>) can use 
<code>finalize</code> to perform their own cleanup as necessary. For example, <code>finalize</code> 
can be used to deactivate an object server.
<p><h1><a name="2490">
The Semantics of Object Methods Declared final
</a></h1>The following methods are declared <code>final</code> by the <code>Object</code> class and cannot be 
overridden:
<p><ul><li><code>getClass
</code><li><code>notify
</code><li><code>notifyAll
</code><li><code>wait
</code></ul>The default implementation for <code>getClass</code> is appropriate for all Java objects, 
local or remote; the method needs no special implementation for remote 
objects. When used on a remote object, the <code>getClass</code> method reports the exact 
type of the generated stub object. Note that this type reflects only the remote 
interfaces implemented by the object, not its local interfaces.
<p>The <code>wait</code> and <code>notify</code> methods of Object deal with waiting and notification in 
the context of the Java language's threading model. While use of these 
methods for remote objects does not break the Java threading model, these 
methods do not have the same semantics as they do for local Java objects. 
Specifically, using these methods operates on the client's local reference to the 
remote object (the stub), not the actual object at the remote site.
<p><h1><a name="357">
Locating Remote Objects
</a></h1>A simple bootstrap name server is provided for storing named references to 
remote objects. A remote object reference can be stored using the URL-based 
methods of the class <code>java.rmi.Naming</code>.
<p>For a client to invoke a method on a remote object, that client must first obtain 
a reference to the object. A reference to a remote object is usually obtained as a 
return value in a method call. The RMI system provides a simple bootstrap 
name server from which to obtain remote objects on given hosts. The 
<code>java.rmi.Naming</code> class provides Uniform Resource Locator (URL) based 
methods to look up, bind, rebind, unbind, and list the name-object pairings 
maintained on a particular host and port.
<p>Here's an example, (without exception handling) of how to bind and look up 
remote objects:
<p><dl><a name="360"><pre>BankAccount acct = new BankAcctImpl();
String url = "rmi://java.Sun.COM/account";
// bind url to remote object
java.rmi.Naming.bind(url, acct);
	...
// lookup account
acct = (BankAccount)java.rmi.Naming.lookup(url);
</pre></a></dl>
