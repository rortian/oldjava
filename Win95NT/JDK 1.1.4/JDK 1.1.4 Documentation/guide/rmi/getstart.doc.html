<h1>Getting Started	 Using RMI</h1>
</a>
<hr><p>
<p>This chapter shows you the steps to follow to create a distributed version of 
the classic Hello World program using Java Remote Method Invocation 
(RMI).
<p>The distributed Hello World example uses an applet to make a remote method 
call to the server from which it was downloaded to retrieve the message "Hello 
World!". When the applet runs, the message is displayed on the client.
<p>To accomplish this, you will work through the following three lessons:
<p><ul><li><a href="getstart.doc.html#7738">Write The HTML and Java Source Files</a>
<li><a href="getstart.doc.html#7437">Compile and Deploy Class Files and HTML Files</a>
<li><a href="getstart.doc.html#7445">Start the Remote Object Registry, Server, and Applet</a>
</ul><h1><a name="7738">
Write The HTML and Java Source Files
</a></h1>There are four source files for the Hello World server and applet:
<p><ol>
<li>The Java remote interface.
<li>The Java remote object (server) which implements the remote interface.
<li>The Java applet that remotely invokes the server's method.
<li>The HTML code for the web page that references the applet.
</ol>
Because the Java language requires a mapping between the fully qualified 
package name of a class file and the directory path to that class, before you 
begin writing Java code you need to decide on package and directory names. 
(This mapping allows the Java compiler to know the directory in which to find 
the class files mentioned in a Java program.) For the Hello World program 
developed in this chapter, the package name is <code>examples.hello</code> and the root 
directory is <code>$HOME/jdk1.1/mysrc/examples/hello</code>.
<p>For example, to create the directory for your source files on Solaris, execute this 
command:
<p><dl><a name="6640"><pre>mkdir $HOME/jdk1.1/mysrc/examples/hello
</pre></a></dl><h2><a name="5174">
Define a Remote Interface
</a></h2>Remote method invocations can fail in very different ways from local method 
invocations, due to network related communication problems and server 
problems. To indicate that it is a remote object, an object implements a remote 
interface, which has the following characteristics:
<p><ul><li>The remote interface must be public. Otherwise, a client will get an error 
when attempting to load a remote object that implements the remote 
interface.
<li>The remote interface extends the interface <code>java.rmi.Remote</code>.
<li>Each method must declare <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code> in its throws 
clause, in addition to any application-specific exceptions.
<li>A remote object passed as an argument or return value (either directly or 
embedded within a local object) must be declared as the remote interface, 
not the implementation class.
</ul>Here is the interface definition for Hello World. The interface contains just one 
method, <code>sayHello</code>, which returns a string to the caller:
<p><dl><a name="5180"><pre>package examples.hello;
public interface Hello extends java.rmi.Remote {
	String sayHello() throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}
</pre></a></dl><h2><a name="5182">
Write an Implementation Class
</a></h2>To write a remote object, you write a class that implements one or more remote 
interfaces. The implementation class needs to:
<p><ol>
<li>Specify the remote interface(s) being implemented.
<li>Define the constructor for the remote object.
<li>Provide implementations for the methods that can be invoked remotely.
<li>Create and install a security manager.
<li>Create one or more instances of a remote object.
<li>Register at least one of the remote objects with the RMI remote object 
registry, for bootstrapping purposes.
</ol>
For example, here is the source for the <code>HelloImpl.java</code> file, which contains 
the code for the Hello World server. The code is followed by an explanation of 
each of the preceding six steps.
<p><dl><a name="5192"><pre>package examples.hello;

import java.rmi.*;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class HelloImpl
	extends UnicastRemoteObject
	implements Hello
{
	private String name;

	public HelloImpl(String s) throws RemoteException {
		super();
		name = s;
	}

	public String sayHello() throws RemoteException {
		return  "Hello World!";
	}
</pre></a><a name="6994"><pre>	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		// Create and install a security manager
		System.setSecurityManager(new RMISecurityManager());

		try {
			HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl("HelloServer");
			Naming.rebind("//myhost/HelloServer", obj);
			System.out.println("HelloServer bound in registry");
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("HelloImpl err: " + e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
</pre></a></dl><h3><a name="5193">
Implement a Remote Interface
</a></h3>The implementation class for the Hello World example is <code>HelloImpl</code>. An 
implementation class specifies the remote interface(s) it is implementing. 
Optionally, it can indicate the remote server that it is extending, which in this 
example is <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>. Here is the 
<code>HelloImpl</code> class declaration:
<p><dl><a name="5194"><pre>public class HelloImpl
	implements Hello
	extends java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject
</pre></a></dl>Extending <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> indicates that the <code>HelloImpl</code> class is used 
to create a single (nonreplicated) remote object that uses RMI's default sockets-
based transport for communication. If you choose to extend a remote object 
from a nonremote class, you need to explicitly export the remote object by 
calling the method <code>UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject</code>.
<p><h3><a name="5864">
Define the Constructor for the Remote Object
</a></h3>The constructor for a remote class is no different than the constructor for a 
nonremote class: it initializes the variables of each newly created instance of 
the class.
<p>Here is the constructor for the <code>HelloImpl</code> class, which initializes the private 
string variable <code>name</code> with the name of the remote object:
<p><dl><a name="5199"><pre>private String name;
public HelloImpl(String s) throws java.rmi.RemoteException {
	super();
	name = s;
}
</pre></a></dl>Note the following:
<p><ul><li>The <code>super</code> method call invokes the no-arg constructor of 
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code>, which "exports" the remote 
object by listening for incoming calls to the remote object on an anonymous 
port. 
<li>The constructor must throw <code>java.rmi.RemoteException</code>, because RMI's 
attempt to export a remote object during construction might fail if 
communication resources are not available.
</ul>Although the call to the <code>super</code> no-arg constructor occurs by default if omitted, 
it is included in this example to make clear the fact that Java constructs the 
superclass before the class.
<p><h3><a name="5866">
Provide an Implementation for Each Remote Method
</a></h3>The implementation class for a remote object contains the code that 
implements each of the remote methods specified in the remote interface.
<p>For example, here is the implementation for the <code>sayHello</code> method, which 
returns the string <code>Hello World!</code> to the caller.
<p><dl><a name="5206"><pre>public String sayHello() throws RemoteException {
	return  "Hello World!";
}
</pre></a></dl>Arguments to, or return values from, remote methods can be of any Java type, 
including objects, as long as those objects implement the interface 
<code>java.io.Serializable</code>. Most of the core Java classes in <code>java.lang</code> and 
<code>java.util</code> implement the <code>Serializable</code> interface.
<p><ul><li>Local objects are passed by copy, and only the nonstatic and nontransient 
fields are copied by default.
<li>Remote objects are passed by reference. A reference to a remote object is 
actually a reference to a stub, which is a client-side proxy for the remote 
object. Stubs are described fully in <a href="getstart.doc.html#5287">Generate Stubs and 
Skeletons</a>.
</ul><em>	A class can define methods not specified in the remote interface, but 
those methods can only be invoked within the virtual machine running the 
service and cannot be invoked remotely.
</em><p><h3><a name="5872">
Create and Install a Security Manager
</a></h3>The <code>main</code> method of the service first needs to create and install a security 
manager: either the <code>RMISecurityManager</code> or one that you have defined 
yourself. For example:
<p><dl><a name="5210"><pre>System.setSecurityManager(new RMISecurityManager());
</pre></a></dl>A security manager needs to be running so that it can guarantee that the 
classes loaded do not perform "sensitive" operations. If no security manager is 
specified, no class loading for RMI classes, local or otherwise, is allowed.
<p><h3><a name="5908">
Create One or More Instances of a Remote Object
</a></h3>The <code>main</code> method of the service needs to create one or more instances of the 
remote object which provides the service. For example:
<p><dl><a name="5213"><pre>HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl("HelloServer");
</pre></a></dl>The constructor exports the remote object, which means that once created, the 
remote object is ready to begin listening for incoming calls.
<p><h3><a name="5912">
Register a Remote Object
</a></h3>For a caller (client, peer, or applet) to be able to invoke a method on a remote 
object, that caller must first obtain a reference to the remote object. Most of the 
time, the reference will be obtained as a parameter to, or a return value from, 
another remote method call.
<p>For bootstrapping, the RMI system also provides a URL-based registry that 
allows you to bind a URL of the form <code>//host/objectname</code> to the remote 
object, where <code>objectname</code> is a simple string name. Once a remote object is 
registered on the server, callers can look up the object by name, obtain a remote 
object reference, and then remotely invoke methods on the object.
<p>For example, the following code binds the URL of the remote object named 
<code>HelloServer</code> to a reference for the remote object:
<p><dl><a name="5222"><pre>Naming.rebind("//myhost/HelloServer", obj);
</pre></a></dl>Note the following about the arguments to the call:
<p><ul><li>The host defaults to the current host if omitted from the URL, and no 
protocol needs to be specified in the URL.
<li>The RMI runtime substitutes a reference to the remote object's stub for the 
actual remote object reference specified by the <code>obj</code> argument. Remote 
implementation objects like instances of <code>HelloImpl</code> never leave the virtual 
machine where they are created, so when a client performs a lookup in a 
server's remote object registry, a reference to the stub is returned.
<li>Optionally, a port number can be supplied in the URL: for example 
//myhost:1234/HelloServer. The port defaults to 1099. It is necessary to 
specify the port number only if a server creates a registry on a port other 
than the default 1099.
</ul><em>For security reasons, an application can bind or unbind only in the 
registry running on the same host. This prevents a client from removing or 
overwriting any of the entries in a server's remote registry. A lookup, however, 
can be done from any host.
</em><p><h2><a name="5228">
Write an Applet that Uses the Remote Service 
</a></h2>The applet part of the distributed Hello World example remotely invokes the 
HelloServer's <code>sayHello</code> method in order to get the string "Hello World!", 
which is displayed when the applet runs. Here is the code for the applet:
<p><dl><a name="5235"><pre>package examples.hello;

import java.awt.*;
import java.rmi.*;

public class HelloApplet extends java.applet.Applet {
	String message = "";
	public void init() {
		try {
			Hello obj = (Hello)Naming.lookup("//" +
				getCodeBase().getHost() + "/HelloServer");
			message = obj.sayHello();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("HelloApplet exception: " +
				e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
	public void paint(Graphics g) {
		g.drawString(message, 25, 50);
	}
}
</pre></a></dl><ol>
<li>The applet first gets a reference to the "HelloServer" from the server's 
registry, constructing the URL by using the <code>getCodeBase</code> method in 
conjunction with the <code>getHost</code> method.
<li>The applet remotely invokes the <code>sayHello</code> method of the HelloServer 
remote object and stores the return value from the call (the string "Hello 
World!") in a variable named <code>message</code>.
<li>The applet invokes the <code>paint</code> method to draw the applet on the display, 
causing the string "Hello World!" to be displayed.
</ol>
<em>The constructed URL must include the host. Otherwise, the applet's 
lookup will default to the client, and the <code>AppletSecurityManager</code> will 
throw an exception since the applet cannot access the local system, but is 
instead limited to communicating only with the applet host.
</em><p><h2><a name="5236">
Write the Web Page that Contains the Applet
</a></h2>Here is the HTML code for the web page that references the Hello World 
applet:
<p><dl><a name="5238"><pre>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;center&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

The message from the HelloServer is:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;applet codebase="../.."
	code="examples.hello.HelloApplet"
	width=500 height=120&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre></a></dl>Note the following:
<p><ul><li>There needs to be an HTTP server running on the machine from which you 
want to download classes. The applet's <code>codebase</code> attribute indicates the 
URL, as shown here:
<dl><a name="5241"><pre>codebase="../.."
</pre></a>The codebase in this example specifies a directory two levels above the 
directory from which the web page was itself loaded. Using this kind of 
relative path is usually a good idea.
<p></dl><li>The applet's <code>code</code> attribute specifies the fully package-qualified name of the 
applet, in this example <code>examples.hello.HelloApplet</code>:
<dl><a name="5244"><pre>code="examples.hello.HelloApplet"
</pre></a></dl></ul><h1><a name="7437">
Compile and Deploy Class Files and HTML Files
</a></h1>The source code for the Hello World example is now complete and the 
<code>$HOME/jdk1.1/mysrc/hello</code> directory has four files:
<p><ul><li><code>Hello.java</code>, which contains the source code for the Hello remote interface.
<li><code>HelloImpl.java</code>, which is the source code for the HelloImpl remote object 
implementation, the server for the Hello World applet.
<li><code>HelloApplet.java</code>, which is the source code for the applet.
<li><code>index.html</code>, which is the web page that references the Hello World applet.
</ul>In this section, you compile the <code>.java</code> source files to create <code>.class</code> files. You 
then run the <code>rmic</code> compiler to create stubs and skeletons. A stub is a client-
side proxy for a remote object which forwards RMI calls to the server-side 
skeleton, which in turn forwards the call to the actual remote object 
implementation.
<p>When you use the <code>javac</code> and <code>rmic</code> compilers, you must specify where the 
resulting class files should reside. For applets, all files should be in the applet's 
codebase directory. In this chapter, this is <code>$HOME/public_html/codebase</code>. 
<p><em>Some Web servers allow accessing a user's public_html directory via an 
HTTP URL constructed as "http://host/~username/". If your Web server 
does not support this convention, you may use a file URL of the form 
"file://home/username/public_html".
</em><p><h2><a name="5284">
Compile the Java Source Files 
</a></h2>Make sure that the deployment directory <code>$HOME/public_html/codebase</code> 
and the development directory <code>$HOME/jdk1.1/mysrc/examples/hello</code> are 
each visible via the local <code>CLASSPATH</code> on the development machine.
<p>To compile the Java source files, run the <code>javac</code> command as follows:
<p><dl><a name="5286"><pre>javac -d $HOME/public_html/codebase
	Hello.java HelloImpl.java HelloApplet.java
</pre></a></dl>This command creates the directory <code>examples/hello</code> (if it does not already 
exist) in the directory <code>$HOME/public_html/codebase</code>. The command then 
writes to that directory the files <code>Hello.class</code>, <code>HelloImpl.class</code>, and 
<code>HelloApplet.class</code>. These are the remote interface, the server, and the 
applet respectively.
<p><h2><a name="5287">
 Generate Stubs and Skeletons
</a></h2>To create stub and skeleton files, run the <code>rmic</code> compiler on the names of 
compiled class files that contain remote object implementations. <code>rmic</code> takes 
one or more class names as input and produces as output class files of the form 
<code>myImpl</code><code>_Skel.class</code> and <code>myImpl</code><code>_Stub.class</code>.
<p>For example, to create the stub and skeleton for the HelloImpl remote object 
implementation, run <code>rmic</code> like this:
<p><dl><a name="5292"><pre>rmic -d $HOME/public_html/codebase examples.hello.HelloImpl
</pre></a></dl>The <code>-d</code> option indicates the root directory in which to place the compiled stub 
and skeleton files. So the preceding command creates the following files in the 
directory <code>$HOME/public_html/codebase/examples/hello</code>:
<p><ul><li><code>HelloImpl_Stub.class
</code><li><code>HelloImpl_Skel.class
</code></ul>Note that the generated stub implements exactly the same set of remote 
interfaces as the remote object itself. This means that a client can use the Java 
language's built-in operators for casting and type checking. It also means that 
Java remote objects support true object-oriented polymorphism.
<p><h2><a name="5295">
Move the HTML File to the Deployment Directory
</a></h2>To make the web page that references the applet visible to clients, the 
<code>index.html</code> file must be moved from the development directory to the 
<code>codebase</code> directory. For example:
<p><dl><a name="6899"><pre>mv $HOME/jdk1.1/mysrc/examples/hello/index.html
	$HOME/public_html/codebase/examples/hello
</pre></a></dl><h2><a name="6898">
Set Paths for Runtime
</a></h2>Make sure that the $<code>HOME/public_html/codebase</code> directory is available via 
the server's local <code>CLASSPATH</code> when you run the HelloImpl server.
<p><h1><a name="7445">
Start the Remote Object Registry, Server, and Applet
</a></h1><h2><a name="5522">
Start the RMI Bootstrap Registry
</a></h2>The RMI registry is a simple server-side bootstrap name server that allows 
remote clients to get a reference to a remote object. It is typically used only to 
locate the first remote object an application needs to talk to. That object in turn 
will provide application specific support for finding other objects.
<p>To start the registry on the server, execute the <code>rmiregistry</code> command. This 
command produces no output and is typically run in the background. For 
example, on Windows 95 or Windows NT:
<p><dl><a name="7223"><pre>start rmiregistry
</pre></a></dl>(Use <code>javaw</code> if start is not available.)
<p>And on Solaris:
<p><dl><a name="5312"><pre>rmiregistry &amp;
</pre></a></dl>The registry by default runs on port 1099. To start the registry on a different 
port, specify the port number in the command. For example, to start the 
registry on port 2001 on Windows NT:
<p><dl><a name="5314"><pre>start rmiregistry 2001
</pre></a></dl>If the registry is running on a port other than the default, you need to specify 
the port number in the URL-based methods of the <code>java.rmi.Naming</code> class 
when making calls to the registry. For example, if the registry is running on 
port 2001 in the Hello World example, here is the call required to bind the URL 
of the HelloServer to the remote object reference:
<p><dl><a name="5316"><pre>Naming.rebind("//myhost:2001/HelloServer", obj);
</pre></a></dl>Similarly, the URL stored on the web page needs to specify the nondefault port 
number, or else the applet's attempt to look up the server in the registry will 
fail:
<p><dl><a name="5318"><pre>&lt;PARAM name="url" value="//myhost:2001/HelloServer"&gt;
</pre></a></dl><em>You must stop and restart the registry any time you modify a remote 
interface or use modified/additional remote interfaces in a remote object 
implementation. Otherwise, the class bound in the registry will not match the 
modified class.
</em><p><h2><a name="5321">
Start the Server
</a></h2>When starting the server, the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property must be 
specified, so that references to the remote objects created by the server can 
include the URL from which the stub class can be dynamically downloaded to 
the client.
<p>The following command shows how to start the HelloImpl server, specifying 
this property:
<p><dl><a name="7724"><pre>java -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://myhost/~myusrname/codebase/
	examples.hello.HelloImpl &amp;
</pre></a></dl><em>The trailing <code>/</code> in the <code>codebase</code> URL must be specified.
</em><p>A stub class is dynamically loaded into a client's virtual machine only when 
the class is not already available locally.
<p><h2><a name="5326">
Run the Applet
</a></h2>Once the registry and server are running, the applet can be run. An applet is 
run by loading its web page into a browser or appletviewer, as shown here:
<p><dl><a name="5328"><pre>appletviewer
	http://myhost/~myusrname/codebase/examples/hello/index.html &amp;
</pre></a></dl>After running the appletviewer, you will see output similar to the following on 
your display:
<p><a name="7264">
 <center><img src="getstart.doc.anc.gif"></center><p>
