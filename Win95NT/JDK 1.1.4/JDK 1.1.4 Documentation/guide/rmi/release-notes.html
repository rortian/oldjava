<center><h1>RMI and Object Serialization</h1>
<h1>JDK 1.1 Release Notes</h1></center>
<p>
These release notes contain the following sections:
<ul>
<li><a href="#rmi">RMI General Notes</a>
<li><a href="#serial">Serialization General Notes</a>
<li><a href="#fire">RMI through Firewalls via a CGI Program (required under limited conditions)</a>
<li><a href="#bugs">Known Limitations and Bugs</a>
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name=rmi>RMI General Notes</a></h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Two examples illustrate the use of the RMI APIs. The first is
a distributed version of Hello World, which has an accompanying Getting
Started tutorial that explains the basics of using RMI. The second example is
a stock monitoring applet that receives notification when the values of 
the portfolio change and that demonstrates callbacks from an object exported
by the applet.
<p>
<li>Applets developed with the JDK 1.1 release of RMI can be run in the
appletviewer and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/index.html">HotJava 1.0</a>. Full support in
all Java enabled browsers will be available when each Java licensee
incorporates the JDK 1.1 release.  In the interim,
<a href ="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/index.html">RMI on JDK 1.0.2</a> has a Netscape plug-in that allows RMI based applets to
be run in Nescape 3.01.
<p>
</ol>
<h2><a name=serial>Serialization General Notes</a></h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Objects must explicitly declare that they can be written to an
ObjectOutputStream by implementing either the interface <code>java.io.Serializable</code> or the 
  interface <code>java.io.Externalizable</code>. Many of the core classes
 implement the <code>Serializable</code> interface.<p>
<li>Objects implementing the interface <code>java.io.Externalizable</code>
must implement the <code>writeExternal</code> method to save the entire state
of the object and the <code>readExternal</code> method to restore the entire
state of the object.
<p>
<li>To support versioning of classes, each version of a class except the
  first must specify the <code>SerialVersionUID</code> variable. This variable indicates
  the original class version for which the current class is capable of writing
or reading streams. For example: 
<pre>
      static final long serialVersionUID = 3487495895819393L; 
</pre>
<p>
  To obtain this value, use the method
  <code>ObjectStreamClass.getSerialVersionUID</code> or the <code>serialver </code>tool.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
<h2><a name=fire>RMI through Firewalls via a CGI Program (required under limited conditions)</a></h2>
<p>
For a server to support RMI calls from clients behind firewalls that do
not foward HTTP requests to arbitrary ports, a CGI program needs to be
installed on the server host's default HTTP server (listening on port
80).  (Without installion of the CGI program, the server will still
support RMI calls from clients behind typical firewalls.)
<p>
The CGI program "java-rmi.cgi" is responsible for forwarding
HTTP-packaged RMI calls sent to the default HTTP server to be forwarded
to an RMI server listening on a port specified in the URL.
Specifically, when a POST request is sent with the URL path
"/cgi-bin/java-rmi.cgi?forward=<port>", the body of the request will be
sent (as another POST request) to the server listening on the specified
port (must be >= 1024).  The HTTP response from this forwarded request
will be the response to the original request.
<p>
On Solaris:
<p>
In the JDK release, copy the file bin/java-rmi.cgi to the directory to
which your HTTP server maps the URL path "/cgi-bin".  You will need to
edit this script to fill in the proper path for the Java interpreter
on the host machine, as noted in the script comments.
<p>
On Windows 95/NT:
<p>
In the JDK release, copy the file bin/java-rmi.cgi to the directory to
which your HTTP server maps the URL path "/cgi-bin".  For this program
to execute correctly, the system PATH environment variable must include
the directory for the Java interpreter.
<p>
<h2><a name=bugs>Known Limitations and Bugs</a></h2>
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>JDK 1.1 and the RMI Prebeta release are not compatible, if you use
the <code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject</code> method in
your applet or application. This is due to a change in the method signature, 
which in JDK 1.1 now returns a <code>RemoteStub</code> instead of
<code>void</code>.
<p>
<li>On some network configurations the Registry operations of bind,
  rebind and unbind will throw an <code>AccessException</code> in cases where it
  should not.  The Registry implementation restricts these operations
  to clients on the same host as the Registry.  If the hostname or IP
  address does not match the exception is thrown. In some DHCP and PPP
  network configurations the assigned IP address and hostname do not
  match the name assigned to the node.  A workaround is to statically
  and explicitly assign the IP address for the node.
<p>
  On Solaris, another alternative is to change the node name have the
  IP address assigned by PPP, or to set the nodename to "localhost"
  which is bound to the IP address 127.0.0.1.
<p>
<li>Applications (servers) that export remote objects may not exit even if
  all remote objects have been garbage collected (remotely and locally)
  and there are no other non-daemon threads in the process other than an
  RMI thread which keeps the process alive. The current workaround is for
  a server process to call <code>System.exit()</code> to exit the application.
<p>
<li><code>rmic</code> does not currently flag an error if a remote interface implemented
  by a remote class is not public.
<p>
<li>The implementation of the <code>java.rmi.registry.Registry</code> interface does not
  handle stub classes evolving over time. If a remote object
  implementation adds support for an additional interface after its
  previous stub was loaded into the registry, object serialization will
  flag a class mismatch when binding the new stub in the registry. As a
  workaround, a registry must be stopped and restarted if changes are made
  to the remote interfaces implemented by remote object implementation classes.
</ul>
