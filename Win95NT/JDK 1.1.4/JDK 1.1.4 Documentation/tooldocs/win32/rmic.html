<h1>rmic - The Java RMI Stub Compiler</h1>
<blockquote>
<b>rmic</b> generates stubs and skeletons for remote objects.
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
rmic [ <a href="rmic.html#Options">options</a> ] <i>package-qualified-class-name(s)</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
The <b>rmic</b> compiler generates stub and skeleton class files for
remote objects from the names of compiled Java classes that contain
remote object implementations (a remote object is one that implements
the interface <code>java.rmi.Remote</code>). The classes named in the
<b>rmic</b> command must be classes that have been compiled
successfully with the <b>javac</b> command and must be fully package
qualified. For example, running <b>rmic</b> on the class file name
<code>HelloImpl</code> as shown here:
<pre>
rmic hello.HelloImpl
</pre>
<p>
creates the <code>HelloImpl_Skel.class</code> and <code>HelloImpl_Stub.class</code> files.
<p>
A skeleton for a remote object is a server-side entity that contains a method which dispatches calls to the actual remote object implementation.
<p>
A stub is a proxy for a remote object which is responsible for forwarding
method invocations on remote objects to the server where the actual remote object implementation resides. A client's reference to a 
remote object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local stub.
<p>
The stub implements only the remote interfaces, not any local
interfaces that the remote object also implements. Because the
stub implements exactly the same set of remote interfaces as the remote
object itself, a client can use the Java language's built-in operators
for casting and type checking.

<a name=Options>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><b>-classpath path</b>
<dd>
Specifies the path <b>rmic</b> uses to look up classes.
This option overrides the default or the CLASSPATH environment
variable if it is set. Directories are separated by semi-colons. Thus the general 
format for <i>path</i> is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
.;&lt;your_path&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
For example:
<blockquote>
<pre>
.;C:\usr\local\java\classes
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dt><b>-d directory</b>
<dd>
     Specifies the root directory of the class hierarchy. You can use this
     option to specify a destination directory for the stub and skeleton 
     files. For example, the command 
<blockquote><pre>
% rmic -d C:\java\classes foo.MyClass
</pre></blockquote>
     would place the stub and skeleton classes derived from MyClass into
     the directory <tt>C:\java\classes\foo</tt>.  If the <tt>-d</tt> option 
     is not used, the package hierarchy of the target class is ignored, and 
     stub and skeleton files are placed in the current directory.
<p>

<dt><b>-depend</b>
<dd>
Makes the compiler consider recompiling classes which are
referenced from other classes.  Normally, it only recompiles missing or
out-of-date classes that are referred to from source code.
<p>

<dt><b>-g</b>
<dd>
Enables generation of debugging tables. Debugging tables contain 
information about line numbers and local variables - information used
by Java debugging tools. By default, only line numbers are generated, unless
optimization (<i>-O</i>) is turned on.
<p>


<dt><b>-keepgenerated</b>
<dd>
Retains the generated <code>.java</code> source files for the stubs and
skeletons and writes them to the same directory as the
<code>.class</code> files, using the <i>-d</i> option if specified.
<p>

<dt><b>-nowarn</b>
<dd>
Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does not print out any warnings.
<p>

<dt><b>-O</b>
<dd>
Optimizes compiled code by inlining static, final and private methods. 
Note that your classes may get larger in size.
<p>


<dt><b>-show</b>
<dd>
Shows the GUI (graphical user interface) for the <b>rmic</b>
compiler.  Enter one or more package qualified class names
(separated by spaces) and press either the Enter key or the Show button
to create stubs and skeletons.
<p>


<dt><b>-verbose</b>
<dd>
Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about what classes 
are being compiled and what class files are being loaded.
<p>

</dl>
</blockquote>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><b>CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by colons on UNIX and Macintosh and by semicolons on Win95.
For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>
.;C:\usr\local\java\classes
</pre>
</blockquote>

</dl>
