<h1>javac - The Java Compiler</h1>
<blockquote>
<b>javac</b> compiles Java programs.
</blockquote>


<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
   javac [ <a href="javac.html#Options">options</a> ] filename.java ...
   javac_g [ <a href="javac.html#Options">options</a> ] filename.java ...
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<blockquote>
The <b>javac</b> command compiles Java source code into Java bytecodes.
You then use the Java interpreter - the <a href="java.html"><b>java</b></a>
command - to interprete the Java bytecodes.
<p>
Java source code must be contained in files whose filenames end with the
<code>.java</code> extension.
The file name must be constructed from the class name,
as <i>classname</i><code>.java</code>,

if the class is public or is referenced from another source file.

<p>
For every class defined in each source file compiled by <b>javac</b>,
the compiler stores the resulting bytecodes in a <em>class file</em>
with a name of the form <i>classname</i><code>.class</code>.
Unless you specify the <b>-d</b> option, the compiler places each class file
in the same directory as the corresponding source file.
<p>
When the compiler must refer to your own classes you need to specify their 
location.
Use the <b>-classpath</b> option or <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable to 
do this.
The class path is a sequence of directories (or zip files) which
<b>javac</b> searches for classes not already defined in any of the
files specified directly as command arguments.
The compiler looks in the class path for both a source file and a class file,
recompiling the source (and regenerating the class file) if it is newer.

<p>
Set the property <code>javac.pipe.output</code> to <code>true</code> to send 
output messages to <code>System.out</code>. Set <code>javac.pipe.output</code> 
to <code>false</code>, that is, do not set it, to send output messages to 
<code>System.err</code>.
<p>
<b>javac_g</b> is a non-optimized version of <b>javac</b> suitable for
use with debuggers like <a href=jdb.html><b>jdb</b></a>.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
</a>

<blockquote>

<dl>
<dt><b>-classpath</b><i> path</i>
<dd>
Specifies the path <b>javac</b> uses to look up classes needed to run
<b>javac</b> or being referenced by other classes you are
compiling. Overrides the default or the <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment
variable if it is set.  Directories are separated by semi-colons.  It
is often useful for the directory containing the source files to be on
the class path.  You should always include the system classes at the
end of the path.  For example:

<pre>
   javac -classpath .;C:\users\dac\classes;C:\tools\java\classes ...
</pre>

<p>
<dt><b>-d</b><i> directory</i>
<dd>
Specifies the root directory of the class file hierarchy. In other
words, this is essentially a destination directory for your compiled
classes.  For example, doing:
<pre>
   javac -d C:\users\dac\classes MyProgram.java
</pre>
causes the class files for the classes in the
<code>MyProgram.java</code> source file to be saved in the directory
<code>C:\users\dac\classes</code>.

<p>
Note that the <b>-d</b> and <b>-classpath</b> options have independent
effects.  The compiler reads only from the class path, and writes only
to the destination directory.
It is often useful for the destination directory to be on the class path.
If the <b>-d</b> option is not specified, the source files should be
stored in a directory hierarchy which reflects the package structure,
so that the resulting class files can be easily located.
<p>
<dt><b>-encoding</b><i> encoding name</i>
<dd>

Specify the source file encoding name, such as <code>EUCJIS\SJIS</code>. If 
this option is not specified, then the platform default converter is used.
<p>
<dt><b>-g</b>
<dd>
Enables generation of debugging tables. Debugging tables contain 
information about line numbers and local variables - information used
by Java debugging tools. By default, only line numbers are generated, unless
optimization (<b>-O</b>) is turned on.
<p>

<dt><b>-deprecation</b>
<dd>
Enables deprecation warnings. The compiler will emit a warning for
each use of a deprecated member or class (unless the deprecated
member or class is also being compiled or recompiled). A class or
member is deprecated if it contains a documentation comment with the
tag <tt>@deprecated</tt>. 


<dt><b>-nowarn</b>
<dd>
Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does not print out any warnings.
<p>
<dt><b>-O</b>
<dd>
Optimizes compiled code by inlining static, final and private methods. 
Note that your classes may get larger in size.
<p>
<dt><b>-verbose</b>
<dd>
Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about what source 
files are being compiled and what class files are being loaded.
<p>
<dt><b>-depend</b>
<dd>
Causes recompilation of class files on which
the source files given as command line arguments recursively depend.
Without this option, only files that are directly depended on and
missing or out-of-date will be recompiled.  Recompilation does not
extend to missing or out-of-date files only depended on by already
up-to-date class files.
<p>
<dt><b>-J</b><i>javaoption</i>
<dd>
Passes through the string <i>javaoption</i> as a single argument to the
Java interpreter which runs the compiler.  The argument should not
contain spaces.  Multiple argument words must all begin with the prefix
<b>-J</b>, which is stripped.  This is useful for adjusting the
compiler's execution environment or memory usage.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<blockquote>
Each package name has a corresponding directory name. 
In the following examples, the source files are located at 
<code>c:\jdk\src\java\awt\*.java</code>.
 
<h3>Compiling One or More Packages</h3>

To compile a package, the source files (<code>*.java</code>) for that package 
must be located in a directory having the same name as the package.
If a package name is made up of several identifiers (separated by
dots), each identifier represents a different directory.
Thus, all java.awt classes must reside in a directory named java\awt\.
<p>

First, change to the parent directory of the top-most package.  Then
run javac, supplying one or more package names.
<pre>
  % cd c:\jdk\src
  % javac java.awt java.awt.event
</pre>
Compiles the public classes in packages <code>java.awt</code> and
<code>java.awt.event</code>.

<h3>Compiling One or More Classes</h3>

Change to the directory holding the class.  Then run javac, supplying
one or more class names.
<pre>
  % cd c:\jdk\src\java\awt
  % javac Button.java Canvas.java
</pre>
Compiles the two classes.

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by semi-colons, for example,
<pre>
   .;C:\users\dac\classes;C:\tools\java\classes
</pre>
</dl>
