<h1>jre - The Java Runtime Interpreter (Win32)</h1>

<blockquote>

<b>jre</b> interprets (executes) Java bytecodes.

</blockquote>



<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>
   jre [ <a href="#Options">options</a> ] classname &lt;args&gt;
   jrew [ <a href="#Options">options</a> ] classname &lt;args&gt;
</pre>



<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<blockquote>

The <b>jre</b> command executes Java <code>class</code> files. The 

<b>jrew</b> command is identical to <b>jre</b>, except that with 

<b>jrew</b> there is no associated console window. Use <b>jrew</b> 

when you don't want a command prompt window to appear.

<p>

The <code>classname</code> argument is the name of the class file to be 
executed. Any arguments to be passed to the class must be placed 
after the <code>classname</code> on the command line.

On Windows platforms, the <b>jre</b> tool ignores the CLASSPATH environment 
variable. The <code>-cp</code> option should be used to specify an 
application's class path.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

</a>



<dl>

<dt><b>-classpath</b><i> path(s)</i>

<dd>

Specifies the path or paths that <b>jre</b> uses to look up classes. 
Overrides the default classpath set in the registry. 
If more than one path is specified, they must be separated by semicolons. 
Each path should end with the directory containing the class file(s) to 
be executed. However, if a file to be executed is a <code>zip</code> 
or <code>jar</code> file, the path to that file must end with the file's 
name. Here is an example of an argument for <tt>-classpath</tt> consisting 
of two paths:

<pre>
   C:\xyz\classes;C:\usr\local\java\classes\MyClasses.jar
</pre>

<p>


<dt><b>-cp</b><i> path(s)</i>

<dd>

Prepends the specified path or paths to the base classpath that 
<b>jre</b> uses to look up classes. If more than one path 
is specified, they must be separated by semicolons. Each path should end 
with the directory containing the class file(s) to be executed. However, 
if a file to be executed is a <cocd>zip</code> or <code>jar</code> 
file, the path to that file must end with the file's name. 
Here is an example of an argument for <tt>-cp</tt> consisting of two paths:

<pre>
   C:\xyz\classes;C:\usr\local\java\classes\MyClasses.jar
</pre>

<p>


<dt><b>-help</b>  

<dd> 

Print a usage message.

<p> 


<dt><b>-mx</b> <i>x</i>

<dd>

Sets the maximum size of the memory allocation pool (the garbage collected

heap) to <i>x</i>. The default is 16 megabytes of memory. <i>x</i> must be

greater than or equal to 1000 bytes.

<p>

By default, <i>x</i> is measured in bytes. You can specify <i>x</i> in either

kilobytes or megabytes by appending the letter &quot;k&quot; for kilobytes or

the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes.

<p>



<dt><b>-ms</b> <i>x</i>

<dd>

Sets the startup size of the memory allocation pool (the garbage collected

heap) to <i>x</i>. The default is 1 megabyte of memory. <i>x</i> must be

&gt; 1000 bytes.

<p>

By default, <i>x</i> is measured in bytes. You can specify <i>x</i> in either

kilobytes or megabytes by appending the letter &quot;k&quot; for kilobytes or

the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes.

<p>



<dt><b>-noasyncgc</b>

<dd>

Turns off asynchronous garbage collection. When activated no garbage

collection takes place unless it is explicitly called or the program 

runs out of memory. Normally garbage collection runs as an asynchronous 

thread in parallel with other threads.

<p>



<dt><b>-noclassgc</b>

<dd>

Turns off garbage collection of Java classes. By default, the Java interpreter

reclaims space for unused Java classes during garbage collection.

<p>


<dt><b>-nojit</b>

<dd>

Specifies that any JIT compiler should be ignored.  The default Java 
interpreter is invoked.

<p>



<dt><b>-ss</b> <i>x</i>

<dd>

Each Java thread has two stacks: one for Java code and one for C code.

The <code>-ss</code> option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by 
C code 

in a thread to <i>x</i>. Every thread that is spawned during the execution of

the program passed to <b>jre</b> has <i>x</i> as its C stack size. The 
default

units for <i>x</i> are bytes. The value of <i>x</i> must be greater

than or equal to 1000 bytes.

<p>

You can modify the meaning of <i>x</i> by appending either the letter 
&quot;k&quot;

for kilobytes or the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes. The default stack 
size

is 128 kilobytes ("-ss 128k").

<p>



<dt><b>-oss</b> <i>x</i>

<dd>

Each Java thread has two stacks: one for Java code and one for C code.

The <code>-oss</code> option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by 
Java code 

in a thread to <i>x</i>. Every thread that is spawned during the execution of

the program passed to <b>jre</b> has <i>x</i> as its Java stack size. The 
default 

units for <i>x</i> are bytes. The value of <i>x</i> must be greater

than or equal to 1000 bytes.

<p>

You can modify the meaning of <i>x</i> by appending either the letter 
&quot;k&quot;

for kilobytes or the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes. The default stack 
size is

400 kilobytes ("-oss 400k").

<p>



<dt><b>-v, -verbose</b>

<dd>

Causes <b>jre</b> to print a message to stdout each time a class file is 

loaded.

<p>



<dt><b>-verify</b>

<dd>

Performs byte-code verification on the class file. Beware, 
however, that <b>java -verify</b> does not perform a full verification 
in all situations. Any code path that is not actually executed 
by the interpreter is not verified. Therefore, <b>java -verify</b> 
cannot be relied upon to certify class files unless all code 
paths in the class file are actually run.
<p>



<dt><b>-verifyremote</b>

<dd>

Runs the verifier on all code that is loaded into the system via a

classloader. <i>verifyremote</i> is the default for the interpreter.

<p>



<dt><b>-noverify</b>

<dd>

Turns verification off.

<p>



<dt><b>-verbosegc</b>

<dd>

Causes the garbage collector to print out messages whenever it frees 

memory.

<p>

<dt><b>-D</b><i>propertyName=newValue</i>
<dd>
Defines a property value. <i>propertyName</i> is the name of the 
property whose value you want to change and <i>newValue</i> is the 
value to change it to. For example, this command line
<pre>
% jre -Dawt.button.color=green ...
</pre>
sets the value of the property awt.button.color to "green". <b>jre</b> 
accepts any number of <tt>-D</tt> options on the command line.
