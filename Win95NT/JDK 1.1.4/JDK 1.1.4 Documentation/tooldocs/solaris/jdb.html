<h1>jdb - The Java Debugger</h1>
<blockquote>
<b>jdb</b> helps you find and fix bugs in Java language programs.
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>
   jdb [ <a href="jdb.html#Options">options</a> ]
</pre>


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
The Java Debugger, <b>jdb</b>, is a dbx-like command-line debugger for Java 
classes. It uses the Java Debugger API
to provide inspection and debugging of a local or remote Java interpreter.
<p>

<h3>Starting a jdb Session</h3>
<blockquote>
Like dbx, there are two ways <b>jdb</b> can be used for debugging. The most
frequently used way is to have <b>jdb</b> start the Java interpreter with
the class to be debugged. This is done by substituting the command <b>jdb</b>
for <b>java</b> in the command line. For example, to start HotJava under
<b>jdb</b>, you use the following: 

<pre width=80>
   % jdb sun.applet.AppletViewer
</pre>

or

<pre width=80>
   % jdb -classpath $INSTALL_DIR/classes sun.applet.AppletViewer
</pre>

When started this way, <b>jdb</b> invokes a second Java interpreter with any
specified parameters, loads the specified class, and stops the 
interpreter before executing
that class's first instruction.

<p>
The second way to use <b>jdb</b> is by attaching it to a Java interpreter
that is already running. For security reasons, Java interpreters can only
be debugged if they have been started with the <i>-debug</i> option.
When started with the <i>-debug</i> option, the Java interpreter prints
out a password for <b>jdb</b>'s use.

<p>
To attach <b>jdb</b> to a running Java interpreter (once the session 
password is known), invoke it as follows:

<pre width=80>
   % jdb -host &lt;hostname&gt; -password &lt;password&gt;
</pre>

</blockquote>

<h3>Basic jdb Commands</h3>
The following is a list of the basic <b>jdb</b> commands. The Java debugger
supports other commands which you can list using <b>jdb</b>'s <tt>help</tt>
command.
<p>
<em>NOTE: To browse local (stack) variables, the class must have been
compiled with the <i>-g</i> option.</em>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>help</b>, or <b>?</b>
<dd>
The most important <b>jdb</b> command, <tt>help</tt> displays the list of
recognized commands with a brief description.

<dt><b>print</b>
<dd>
Browses Java objects. The <tt>print</tt> command calls the object's
<tt>toString()</tt> method, so it will be formatted differently depending
on its class.
<p>
Classes are specified by either their object ID or by name. If a class is 
already loaded, a substring can be used, such as <tt>Thread</tt> for 
<tt>java.lang.Thread</tt>. 
<p>
<tt>print</tt> supports Java expressions, such as <tt>print MyClass.clsVar</tt>.
Method invocation is not currently supported.
<p>

<dt><b>dump</b>
<dd>
Dumps an object's instance variables. Objects are specified by their
object ID (a hexadecimal integer).
<p>
Classes are specified by either their object ID or by name. If a class is 
already loaded, a substring can be used, such as <tt>Thread</tt> for 
<tt>java.lang.Thread</tt>. If a class isn't loaded, its full name must be
specified, and the class will be loaded as a side effect. This is needed
to set breakpoints in referenced classes before an applet runs.
<p>
The <tt>dump</tt> command supports Java expressions such as
<tt>dump 0x12345678.myCache[3].foo</tt>. Method invocation 
is not currently supported.
<p>

<dt><b>threads</b>
<dd>
Lists the current threads. This lists all threads, organized by thread group. 
Threads are referenced by their object ID, or if they
are in the current thread group, with the form <tt>t@&lt;index&gt;</tt>, such
as <tt>t@3</tt>.
<p>

<dt><b>where</b> 
<dd>
<code>where</code> with no arguments dumps the stack of the current thread
(which is
set with the <tt>thread</tt> command).
<code>where all</code> dumps the stack of all threads in the current thread
group. <code>where </code><i>threadid</i> dumps the stack of the specified thread.
<i>threadid</i> takes the form of <tt>t@&lt;index&gt;</tt>, such
as <tt>t@3</tt>.
If a requested thread is suspended (either
because it's at a breakpoint or via the <tt>suspend</tt> command), local
(stack) and instance variables can be browsed with the <tt>print</tt> and
<tt>dump</tt> commands. The <tt>up</tt> and <tt>down</tt> commands select
which stack frame is current.

</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3>Breakpoints</h3>
<blockquote>
Breakpoints are set in <b>jdb</b> in classes, such as "<tt>stop at MyClass:45</tt>".
The source file line number must be specified, or the name of the method (the
breakpoint will then be set at the first instruction of that method). The
<tt>clear</tt> command removes breakpoints using a similar syntax, while the
<tt>cont</tt> command continues execution. Single-stepping is available via <tt>step</tt>.
</blockquote>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<blockquote>
When an exception occurs for which there isn't a catch statement anywhere up
a Java program's stack, the Java runtime normally dumps an exception trace
and exits. When running under <b>jdb</b>, however, that exception is
treated as a non-recoverable breakpoint, and <b>jdb</b> stops at the 
offending instruction. If that class was compiled with the <i>-g</i>
option, instance and local variables can be printed to determine the cause
of the exception.

<p>
Specific exceptions may be caught with the <tt>catch</tt> command,
for example: "<tt>catch FileNotFoundException</tt>" or 
"<tt>catch mypackage.BigTroubleException</tt>. The Java debugging facility 
keeps a list of these exceptions, and when one is thrown, it is treated as if 
a breakpoint had been on the instruction which caused the exception. 
The <tt>ignore</tt> command removes exception classes from this list.

<p>
<em>NOTE: The <tt>ignore</tt> command does not cause the Java interpreter
to ignore specific exceptions, only the debugger.</em>

<a name=Options>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
When you use <b>jdb</b> in place of the Java interpreter on the command line,
<b>jdb</b> accepts the same options as the <a href=java.html>java</a> command.

<p>
When you use <b>jdb</b> to attach to a running Java interpreter session,
<b>jdb</b> accepts these options:

<dl>
<dt><b>-host <i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i></b>
<dd>
Sets the name of the host machine on which the interpreter session to attach
to is running.

<dt><b>-password <i>&lt;password&gt;</i></b>
<dd>
"Logs in" to the active interpreter session. This is the password printed by
the Java interpreter prints out when invoked with the <i>-debug</i> option.

</dl>
</blockquote>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<blockquote>
 
<dl>

<dt><b>CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by colons, for example,

<pre>
   .:/home/avh/classes:/usr/local/java/classes
</pre>


</dl>
