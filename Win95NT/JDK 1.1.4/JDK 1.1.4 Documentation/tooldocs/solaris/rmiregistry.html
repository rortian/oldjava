<h1>rmiregistry - The Java Remote Object Registry</h1>
<blockquote>
The <b>rmiregistry</b> command starts a remote object registry on the 
specified port on the current host.
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
rmiregistry [<i>port</i>]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
The <b>rmiregistry</b> command creates and starts a remote object registry on the specified <i>port</i> on the current host. If <i>port</i> is omitted, the registry is started on port 1099. The <b>rmiregistry</b> command produces no
output and is typically run in the background. For example:
<p>
<code>rmiregistry &</code>
<p>
A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service which is used by
RMI servers on a host to bind remote objects to names. Clients can then look up remote objects and make remote
method invocations.
<p>
The registry is typically used to locate the first remote object on which
an application needs to invoke methods. That object in turn will provide
application-specific support for finding other objects.
<p>
The methods of the <code>java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry</code> class are
used to get a registry operating on a particular host or host and port.
<p>
The URL-based methods of the <code>java.rmi.Naming</code> class operate on a
registry and can be used to look up a remote object, bind a simple (string)
name to a remote object, rebind a new name to a remote object (overriding
the old binding), unbind a remote object, and list the URLs bound in the
registry.
