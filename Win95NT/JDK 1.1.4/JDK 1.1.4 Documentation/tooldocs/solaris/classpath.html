<h1>CLASSPATH</h1>
<blockquote>
The <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable tells the Java Virtual Machine 
and other Java applications (for example, the Java tools located in the 
<code>jdk1.1.x/bin</code> directory) 
where to find the class libraries, including user-defined class 
libraries. 
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
The CLASSPATH environment variable is set with the <b>setenv</b> 
command. Using <b>setenv</b> at the command line changes the 
current value of CLASSPATH. You can also use <b>setenv</b> in 
your startup file to specify a CLASSPATH at startup. The format is:
<pre>
   setenv CLASSPATH <i>path1</i>:<i>path2</i> ...
</pre>
where a path to a .zip or .jar file must terminate with the filename, 
and a path to a .class file must terminate with the directory name. The 
Java interpreter will search the paths for a class by name and load 
the first one it finds.
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
The CLASSPATH tells the Java Virtual Machine and other Java 
applications and tools  
where to find the class libraries. The class libraries that 
the CLASSPATH points to may be the JDK classes (contained in 
the <code>classes.zip</code> file in the <code>lib</code> directory) 
and/or any classes that you want to use.
<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Default CLASSPATH setting</b>
<dd>
If you followed the default JDK
installation procedure, you probably do not need to set 
CLASSPATH because the
shell scripts automatically append the following 
to the current CLASSPATH:
<pre>
   .:[bin]/../classes:[bin]/../lib/classes.zip
</pre>
In this expression, <code>[bin]</code> is the absolute path to the 
<code>jdk1.1.x/bin</code> directory.  Therefore, if you keep the 
<code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> directories at the same 
directory level, the Java executables
will find the JDK classes (contained in the <code>classes.zip</code> 
file). Note that the default CLASSPATH also 
includes a path to a <code>classes</code> directory on the same 
directory level as <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code>. You can 
put your own (unzipped) class files 
in a <code>classes</code> directory that you create, and the Java 
executables will be able to find them with the default CLASSPATH.
<p>
You should also be aware that some third-party applications that use the 
Java Virtual Machine may modify your CLASSPATH environment variable.
<p>
<dt><b>Setting CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
You need to set the CLASSPATH if you move the JDK's 
<code>classes.zip</code> 
file or if you want to load a class library that's 
not in a location specified by the default CLASSPATH.  To set 
CLASSPATH, use the <b>setenv</b> command. 
<p>
Classes can be saved either in individual class files, such as 
<code>MyClass.class</code>, or in groups in a file such as 
<code>classes.zip</code> or <code>classes.jar</code>. 
When specifying a path to a .zip or .jar file, you 
must end the path with the filename. When specifying a path to 
.class files, that path should end with the directory containing 
the .class files.  For example, if you 
have class files in the directory <code>/home/MyClasses</code>, 
you could set the CLASSPATH with the following:
<pre>
   setenv CLASSPATH /home/MyClasses
</pre>
If you also wanted to include the path <code>/home/OtherClasses</code>, 
you could use the command:
<pre>
   setenv CLASSPATH /home/MyClasses:/home/OtherClasses
</pre>
Note that the two paths are separated by a colon.
<p>
The order in which you specify multiple directories in the CLASSPATH 
variable is important. The Java interpreter will look for classes in 
the directories 
in the order they appear in the CLASSPATH variable. In the 
example above, the Java interpreter will first look for a needed 
class in the directory <code>/home/MyClasses</code>. Only if it doesn't find a 
class with the proper name in that directory will the interpreter 
look in the <code>/home/OtherClasses</code> directory.
<p>
If you want to use a class library that is in a zipped file, you 
must include the name of that file in the CLASSPATH, for example:
<pre>
   setenv CLASSPATH /home/MyClasses/myclasses.zip
</pre>
<p>
If you want the CLASSPATH to point to class files that belong to 
a package, you should 
specify a path name that includes the path to the directory <em>one 
level above</em> the directory having the name of your package. For 
example, suppose you want the Java interpreter to be able to find 
classes in 
the package <code>mypackage</code>. If the path to the 
<code>mypackage</code> directory is 
<code>/home/MyClasses/mypackage</code>, you would set the CLASSPATH 
variable as follows:
<pre>
   setenv CLASSPATH /home/MyClasses
</pre>
<p>

<dt><b>Unsetting CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
If your CLASSPATH environment variable has been set to a value 
that is not correct, or 
if your startup file or script is setting an incorrect path, you can 
unset CLASSPATH by using:
<pre>
   unsetenv CLASSPATH
</pre>
This command unsets only CLASSPATH's current value. You should also delete 
or modify the lines in your startup file that may be setting an 
incorrect CLASSPATH.
<p>

<dt><b>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
The wrappers that invoke the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) unset the 
CLASSPATH variable before starting the Java interpreter. The reason is 
simple: there might be several Java applications
installed on the machine. If you or someone else previously installed a Java development
tool that modified the .cshrc or
.login script, then CLASSPATH may point at a JDK1.0.2-based Java runtime.
If such a CLASSPATH were left intact when the Java
interpreter is invoked, then it will be loading 1.0.2 classes. If your 
app relies on 1.1 features, it will fail. Just as bad, it's
unlikely that the classes for your app will even be found in that
CLASSPATH. Unsetting CLASSPATH before invoking the JRE
interpreter sanitizes your application against unpredictable results.
<p>
The default CLASSPATH used by the JRE is: 

<pre>
   [jre_path]/lib/rt.jar:[jre_path]/lib/i18n.jar:[jre_path]/lib/classes.jar:[jre_path]/lib/classes.zip:[jre_path]/classes
</pre>   

where <code>[jre_path]</code> is the absolute path of the 
<code>jre1.1.x</code> 
directory (it has <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> directories 
underneath it).
The files <code>rt.jar</code> and <code>i18n.jar</code> are used to 
hold the runtime's (required) 
core classes and (optional) internationalization classes. While you 
can store the classes specific to your application in
either <code>[jre_path]/lib/classes.jar</code> or as individual class 
files in
the <code>[jre_path]/classes</code> subdirectory, it is better to 
keep the JRE 
separate from your application and use CLASSPATH to point the 
interpreter to your application's class files.
<p>

<dt><b>Using both JDK 1.0.2 and JDK 1.1.x</b>
<dd>
If you want to develop in both JDK 1.0.2 and JDK 1.1.x, you must 
set CLASSPATH separately for each one. To use both JDKs 
simultaneously, you can run them from separate shell windows each 
having its own value for CLASSPATH. If you are running only one at 
a time, you can write a batch script to switch the value of 
CLASSPATH as appropriate.
<p>

<dt><b>The Java tools' -classpath option</b>
<dd>
Some of the Java tools such as <a href="java.html">java</a>, 
<a href="javac.html">javac</a>, 
and <a href="javah.html">javah</a> have a <b>-classpath</b> option 
which can be used to 
override the path or paths specified by the CLASSPATH environment 
variable.
