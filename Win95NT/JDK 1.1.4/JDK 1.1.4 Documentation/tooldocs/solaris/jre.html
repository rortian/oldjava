<h1>jre - The Java Runtime Interpreter (Solaris)</h1>
<blockquote>
<b>jre</b> interprets (executes) Java bytecodes.
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<pre>
jre [ <a href="#Options">options</a> ] classname &lt;args&gt;
</pre>


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
The <b>jre</b> command executes Java <code>class</code> files.
The <code>classname</code> argument is the name of the class to be executed.
Any arguments to be passed to the class must be placed 
after the <code>classname</code> on the command line.
<p>
Class paths for the Solaris version of the <b>jre</b> tool can be 
specified using the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable or by 
using the <tt>-classpath</tt> or <tt>-cp</tt> options. The Windows 
version of the <b>jre</b> tool ignores the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> 
environment variable. For both Solaris and Windows, the <tt>-cp</tt> 
option is recommend for specifying class paths when using <tt>jre</tt>.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
</a>

<dl>

<dt><b>-classpath</b><i>&nbsp; &nbsp;path(s)</i>
<dd>
Specifies the path or paths that <b>jre</b> uses to look up classes. 
Overrides the default or the CLASSPATH environment variable if it is set. 
If more than one path is specified, they must be separated by colons. 
Each path should end with the directory containing the class file(s) to 
be executed. However, if a file to be executed is a <code>zip</code> 
or <code>jar</code> file, the path to that file must end with the file's 
name. Here is an example of an argument for <tt>-classpath</tt> that 
specifies three paths consisting of the current directory and two 
additional paths:

<pre>
   .:/home/xyz/classes:/usr/local/java/classes/MyClasses.jar
</pre>

<p>

<dt><b>-cp</b><i>&nbsp; &nbsp;path(s)</i>
<dd>
Prepends the specified path or paths to the base classpath or path 
given by the CLASSPATH environment variable. If more than one path 
is specified, they must be separated by colons. Each path should end 
with the directory containing the class file(s) to be executed. However, 
if a file to be executed is a <cocd>zip</code> or <code>jar</code> 
file, the path to that file must end with the file's name. 
Here is an example of an argument for <tt>-cp</tt> that specifies three 
paths consisting of the current directory and two additional paths:

<pre>
   .:/home/xyz/classes:/usr/local/java/classes/MyClasses.jar
</pre>

<p>

<dt><b>-help</b>  
<dd> 
Print a usage message.
<p> 

<dt><b>-mx</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>x</i>
<dd>
Sets the maximum size of the memory allocation pool (the garbage collected
heap) to <i>x</i>. The default is 16 megabytes of memory. <i>x</i> must be
greater than or equal to 1000 bytes.
<p>
By default, <i>x</i> is measured in bytes. You can specify <i>x</i> in either
kilobytes or megabytes by appending the letter &quot;k&quot; for kilobytes or
the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes.
<p>

<dt><b>-ms</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>x</i>
<dd>
Sets the startup size of the memory allocation pool (the garbage collected
heap) to <i>x</i>. The default is 1 megabyte of memory. <i>x</i> must be
&gt; 1000 bytes.
<p>
By default, <i>x</i> is measured in bytes. You can specify <i>x</i> in either
kilobytes or megabytes by appending the letter &quot;k&quot; for kilobytes or
the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes.
<p>

<dt><b>-noasyncgc</b>
<dd>
Turns off asynchronous garbage collection. When activated no garbage
collection takes place unless it is explicitly called or the program 
runs out of memory. Normally garbage collection runs as an asynchronous 
thread in parallel with other threads.
<p>

<dt><b>-noclassgc</b>
<dd>
Turns off garbage collection of Java classes. By default, the Java interpreter
reclaims space for unused Java classes during garbage collection.
<p>

<dt><b>-nojit</b>
<dd>
Specifies that any JIT compiler should be ignored and instead invokes 
the default Java interpreter.
<p>


<dt><b>-ss</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>x</i>
<dd>
Each Java thread has two stacks: one for Java code and one for C code.
The <code>-ss</code> option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by 
C code 
in a thread to <i>x</i>. Every thread that is spawned during the execution of
the program passed to <b>jre</b> has <i>x</i> as its C stack size. The 
default
units for <i>x</i> are bytes. The value of <i>x</i> must be greater
than or equal to 1000 bytes.
<p>
You can modify the meaning of <i>x</i> by appending either the letter 
&quot;k&quot;
for kilobytes or the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes. The default stack 
size
is 128 kilobytes ("-ss 128k").
<p>

<dt><b>-oss</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>x</i>
<dd>
Each Java thread has two stacks: one for Java code and one for C code.
The <code>-oss</code> option sets the maximum stack size that can be used by 
Java code 
in a thread to <i>x</i>. Every thread that is spawned during the execution of
the program passed to <b>jre</b> has <i>x</i> as its Java stack size. The 
default 
units for <i>x</i> are bytes. The value of <i>x</i> must be greater
than or equal to 1000 bytes.
<p>
You can modify the meaning of <i>x</i> by appending either the letter 
&quot;k&quot;
for kilobytes or the letter &quot;m&quot; for megabytes. The default stack 
size is
400 kilobytes ("-oss 400k").
<p>

<dt><b>-v,&nbsp; &nbsp;-verbose</b>
<dd>
Causes <b>jre</b> to print a message to stdout each time a class file is 
loaded.
<p>

<dt><b>-verify</b>
<dd>
Performs byte-code verification on the class file. Beware, 
however, that <b>java -verify</b> does not perform a full verification 
in all situations. Any code path that is not actually executed 
by the interpreter is not verified. Therefore, <b>java -verify</b> 
cannot be relied upon to certify class files unless all code 
paths in the class file are actually run.
<p>

<dt><b>-verifyremote</b>
<dd>
Runs the verifier on all code that is loaded into the system via a
classloader. <i>verifyremote</i> is the default for the interpreter.
<p>

<dt><b>-noverify</b>
<dd>
Turns verification off.
<p>

<dt><b>-verbosegc</b>
<dd>
Causes the garbage collector to print out messages whenever it frees 
memory.
<p>


<dt><b>-D</b><i>propertyName=newValue</i>
<dd>
Defines a property value. <i>propertyName</i> is the name of the 
property whose value you want to change and <i>newValue</i> is the 
value to change it to. For example, this command line
<pre>
% jre -Dawt.button.color=green ...
</pre>
sets the value of the property awt.button.color to "green". <b>jre</b> 
accepts any number of <tt>-D</tt> options on the command line.

</dl>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>CLASSPATH
<dd>
You can use the CLASSPATH environment variable to specify the path to 
the class file or files that you want to execute. CLASSPATH consists 
of a colon-separated list of directories that contain the class files 
to be executed. 
For example:

<pre>
   .:/home/xyz/classes
</pre>

If the file to be executed is a <code>zip</code> file or a 
<code>jar</code> file, the path should end with the file name. 
For example:

<pre>
   .:/usr/local/java/classes/MyClasses.jar
</pre>

</dl>
