<H1>javakey - The Java Security Tool</H1>
<blockquote>
Manages a database of entities (people, companies, etc.) and their public 
and private keys and certificates. Also generates and verifies signatures 
for archive files.
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>javakey</strong> [ <a href="javakey.html#Options">options</a> ]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<blockquote>

<b>javakey</b> is the SUN security provider command-line tool 
whose primary use is to generate digital signatures for archive files. 
A signature verifies that a file came from a specified entity (a 
"<i>signer</i>"). In order to generate a signature for a particular file, 
the signer must first have a public/private key pair associated with it, 
and also one or more certificates authenticating its public key. Thus, 
<b>javakey</b> is also used to build and manage a persistent database of 
entities and their keys and certificates, as well as indications as to 
whether or not each entity is considered "trusted."


<h3>Identities, Signers, and Keys</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>There are two types of entities managed by <b>javakey</b>: 
<i>identities</i> and <i>signers</i>. 

<p><i>Identities</i> are real-world entities such as people, companies or
organizations that have a public key associated with them.
An identity may also have associated with it one or more certificates 
authenticating its public key. A certificate is a digitally signed statement
from one entity, saying that the public key of some other entity has a 
particular value. (See <a href = "#Certificates">Certificates</a>.)

<p><i>Signers</i> are entities that have private keys in addition to 
corresponding public keys. Private keys differ from public keys in that 
they can be used for signing. Prior to signing any files, a signer must 
have a public and private key pair associated with it, and at least one 
certificate authenticating its public key.

<p>In <b>javakey</b>, you can either import existing keys or generate new 
ones for association with identities and signers. Similarly, you can either 
import existing certificates or generate new ones.


<h4>Database usernames for identities and signers</h4>

<p>All entities (identities and signers) have a <i>username</i> local to 
the database managed by <b>javakey</b>. A username is specified when you 
add the entity to the database using the <b>-c</b> (create identity) or 
<b>-cs</b> (create signer) option. Subsequent <b>javakey</b> commands must 
use this same username to refer to the entity. For example, suppose a 
trusted signer 
 is created and assigned <tt>duke</tt> as a username, via 
the following command: 

<pre>
    javakey -cs duke true
</pre>

Then to generate a DSA public/private key pair using a key size of 512 bits 
for this signer, you would use the following command:

<pre>
    javakey -gk duke DSA 512
</pre>

<h4>Associating trust with identities and signers</h4>

<p>In JDK 1.1, the client (e.g., end user or system administrator) can 
use <b>javakey</b> to declare certain entities to be trusted.

<p>The appletviewer allows any downloaded applets in JAR files signed (using 
<b>javakey</b>) by a trusted entity to run with the same full rights 
as local applications. That is, such applets are not subject to the 
"sandbox" restrictions of the original Java security model. (Fine point:
The database managed by <b>javakey</b> must also hold a copy of a certificate 
for the public key of the entity that signed the JAR file, so that the
signature can be authenticated.) Later releases will provide greater 
granularity in the allowable trust levels.
 
<p>The database managed by <b>javakey</b> stores the entity usernames, their
<a href = "#Certificates">certificates</a>, and each entity's trust 
level. When you add an entity to the database, you can declare
it at that time to be either trusted or untrusted (the default).   

<pre>
    javakey -cs duke true

    javakey -cs bob false

    javakey -cs morty 
</pre>

The first example creates the signer named <code>duke</code> as a 
trusted entity.   The next two create the signers <code>bob</code>
and <code>morty</code> as untrusted.  If you don't specify a trust level,
then by default, the entity is untrusted. 

<p>You can later on declare a previously untrusted entity
to be trusted: 

<pre>
    javakey -t morty true
</pre>

You can also declare a previously trusted entity to be untrusted: 

<pre>
    javakey -t duke false
</pre>

Use

<pre>
    javakey -ld
</pre>

to see the state of the entire entity database. 

Use

<pre>
    javakey -li morty
</pre>

to see the state of one entity (in this case, <code>morty</code>) in 
the database.

</blockquote>

<h3>Database Location</h3>

<blockquote>

The database managed by javakey is by default stored in a file named 
<i>identitydb.obj</i>.

Since the database may contain private keys, it should be kept in a
secure location. The default is for the database to be stored in the 
user's home directory. If a different name or location (for example,
the JDK installation directory) is desired, it can be specified by 
setting the value of the <code>identity.database</code> property in 
the master security properties file, called <tt>java.security</tt>. 
That file resides in the JDK security properties directory,  
<code><i>java.home</i>/lib/security</code>, where <i>java.home</i> is 
the directory where the JDK is installed.  
<p>For example, you could specify the location via the following:

<pre>
	identity.database=/a/safe/directory/identitydb.obj 
</pre>

</blockquote>



<h3><a name=Certificates>Certificates</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>javakey</b> lets you import, create, display, and save certificates. 
A certificate is a digitally signed statement from one entity (a signer), 
saying that the public key of some other entity has a particular value.
If you trust the entity that signed a certificate, you trust that the 
association in the certificate between the specified public key and another 
particular entity is authentic.

<b>javakey</b> currently handles X.509 certificates.  The remainder
of the examples in this section pertain to X.509 certificates.


<h4><a name=CertificateGeneration>Generating a certificate</a></h4>

<p>In order to generate a certificate, you must first create a directive file
in which you supply 

<ul>

<li>information about the issuer (the signer signing the certificate), 
<li>information about the subject (the entity whose public key is being 
authenticated by the certificate),
<li>information about the certificate itself, and, optionally,
<li>the name of the signature algorithm to be used (if you don't want DSA).
<li>the name of a file to which to store a copy of the certificate.

</ul>

Generate a certificate by using the <code><a href = "#gcOption">-gc</a></code> 
option and specifying a directive file, as in

<pre>
    javakey -gc dukeCertDirFile
</pre>


<p><b>javakey</b> will create a certificate, using the information supplied 
in the directive file. It also uses information stored in the database, such 
as the public key of the entity whose key is to be certified, and the private 
key of the issuer (required in order to sign the certificate).

<p>Here is an example of a certificate directive file, followed by an 
explanation of the arguments:

<pre>
#
# Information about the issuer (required).
#
issuer.name=jsmith

#
# The certificate to use for the signing (required if this is not self-signed).
#
issuer.cert=1

#
# Information about the subject (required).
#
subject.name=mlaunay
subject.real.name=Marie Launay
subject.org.unit=JavaSoft
subject.org=Sun MicroSystems
subject.country=Switzerland

#
# Information about the certificate (required).
#
start.date=1 Jan 1997
end.date=15 Jan 1997
serial.number=1001

#
# Signature algorithm to be used (only required if you don't want DSA used).
#
signature.algorithm=MD5/RSA

#
# Name of the file to which to save a copy of the certificate (optional).
#
out.file=cert.cer

</pre>

<p>All certificate directive file arguments are required, unless specified 
otherwise:

<dl>

<dt><tt>issuer.name</tt> and <tt>subject.name</tt> 

<dd>Database usernames. <code>issuer.name</code> is the name of the signer 
signing and issuing the certificate. <code>subject.name</code> is the name 
of the entity (identity or signer) whose public key is being authenticated 
by the issuer of the certificate.

<dt><tt>issuer.cert</tt> 

<dd>Specifies which of the issuer's certificates is to be used to
sign the certificate file, thereby authenticating the subject's public key.
Its value should be the number that <b>javakey</b> previously assigned to 
the issuer's certificate when it generated it (or imported it). You can see 
which numbers javakey assigns to certificates by viewing the output of the 
<code><a href = "#ldOption">-ld</a></code> or 
<code><a href = "#liOption">-li</a></code> <b>javakey</b> option. Note: 
This <i>issuer.cert</i> property is only required if the certificate being
generated is <i>not</i> self-signed. (A self-signed certificate is one for
which <i>issuer.name</i> equals <i>subject.name</i>.)

<dt><tt>subject.real.name, subject.org.unit, subject.org, and 
subject.country</tt>

<dd>X.500 distinguished name components.  These components refer to the 
subject's common name, organizational unit, organization, and country, respectively.

<dt><tt>start.date</tt> and <tt>end.date</tt>

<dd>Strings specifying the certificate's validity start and expiration 
dates (and optionally times). The certificate is valid from the start date 
and time to the end date and time. The start and end date strings can be 
any strings accepted by the <code>java.util Date</code> method that takes 
a String argument. A date without a time specified is interpreted as 
meaning the start of the specified date.

<dt><tt>serial.number</tt>

<dd>The serial number. For a given issuer, this number must be unique, to 
distinguish this certificate from other certificates signed by the issuer.

<dt><tt>signature.algorithm</tt>

<dd>The name of the signature algorithm to be used to sign the certificate. 
This argument is optional. If there is no <code>signature.algorithm</code> 
specified, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) will be used; in that case, the 
signer's private and public keys must be for the DSA algorithm. A non-DSA 
algorithm can only be used if (1) the specified name is a <a 
href="../../guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#AppA">standard
algorithm name</a>, (2) there is a statically installed <a 
href="../../guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#Provider">provider</a> 
supplying an implementation for the algorithm, and (3) the signer's keys 
are suitable for the specified algorithm. For example, if the value of 
the <code>signature.algorithm</code> property is <code>MD5/RSA</code> or 
<code>SHA-1/RSA</code>, then the signer's keys must be RSA keys.


<dt><tt>out.file</tt>

<dd>The name of a file to which to save the certificate. This argument is
optional.

</dl>


<h4><a name=DisplayCertificate>Certificates and Files</a></h4>

<p>Using <b>javakey</b>, it is possible to display, import, and export
certificates stored as files. 

To display a certificate stored in a file, use the <b>-dc</b> option, as in

<pre>
    javakey -dc certfile.cer
</pre>

<p>This displays information about the certificate stored in the file 
<i>certfile.cer</i>, showing 

<ul>
<li>the certificate type (currently, X.509v1).
<li>information about the subject.
<li>information about the public key:
    <ul>
    <li>the algorithm and its parameters (currently, DSA and its p, q, and 
g parameter values).
    <li>the unparsed key bits.
    </ul>
<li>the certificate validity dates.
<li>information about the issuer.
<li>information about the signature algorithm used.
<li>the certificate serial number, in hexadecimal.
</ul>

To import a certificate from a file, use the <b>-ic</b> option, as in

<pre>
    javakey -ic joe jcertfile.cer
</pre>

This sample command imports the certificate in the file <i>jcertfile.cer</i> 
and associates it with <i>joe</i>.

<p>To export a certificate to a file, use the <b>-ec</b> option, as in

<pre>
    javakey -ec jane 2 janecertfile.cer
</pre>

This sample command exports jane's certificate #2 to the file 
<i>janecertfile.cer</i>. The certificate number must be the number that 
<b>javakey</b> previously assigned to her certificate when it generated 
it (or imported it). You can see which numbers javakey assigns to 
certificates by viewing the output of the 
<code><a href = "#ldOption">-ld</a></code> or the 
<code><a href = "#liOption">-li</a></code> <b>javakey</b> option.

<h3><a name=JARSigning>JAR Files and Digital Signatures</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Java ARchive files (JAR files) are a new feature of JDK1.1.  This feature 
enables the packaging of class files, images, sounds, and other digital data 
in a single file for faster and easier distribution. JDK1.1 includes a tool
named <a href="jar.html"><tt>jar</tt></a> that enables developers to 
produce JAR files.

<p><b>javakey</b> can be used to  sign and verify JAR files. (Note; 
verification is not yet implemented.) Java licensees are expected to honor 
the signature generated using <b>javakey</b>.

<p>At this time, <b>javakey</b> can sign the JAR file using DSA 
(Digital Signature Algorithm) or, in some cases, the MD5/RSA algorithm. 
That is, if the signer's public and private keys are DSA keys, 
<b>javakey</b> will sign the JAR file using DSA. If the signer's keys are 
RSA keys, <b>javakey</b> will try to sign the JAR file 
using the MD5/RSA algorithm. This is only possible if
there is a statically installed <a 
href="../../guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#Provider">provider</a> 
supplying an implementation for the MD5/RSA algorithm.

<p>For both the DSA and MD5/RSA algorithms, anyone who wants to sign files has 
both a public key and a private key. The private key is
used for signing, and a certificate of the public key is included in
the signature file (in a PKCS #7 block).

<h4>Signing JAR Files</h4>

<p>Signing a JAR file involves generating a signature for a given signer and 
including that signature in a given JAR file.  It requires the signer to be in 
the database managed by <b>javakey</b>, along with an associated key pair and 
at least one X.509 certificate. Like certificate generation, generating a signature is 
directive-based. Each directive file contains a signer 
<i>profile</i>. A sample directive file might look like this:<pre>

#
# JAR signing directive. This is the directive file used by javakey to 
# sign a JAR file.
#

# Which signer to use. This signer must be in the database.

signer=duke


# Certificate number to use for this signer. This determines which
# certificate will be included in the PKCS#7 block. This is mandatory
# and is 1-based. Its value should be the number that javakey
# previously assigned to the signer's certificate when it generated it 
# (or imported it). You can see which numbers javakey assigns 
# to certificates by viewing the output of the 
# <code>-ld</code> or <code>-li</code> javakey option. 

cert=1


# Certificate chain depth of a chain of certificates to include. This is
# currently not supported.

chain=0

# The name to give to the generated signature file and associated signature
# block. This must be 8 characters or less.
# The generated signature file and associated signature block will have 
# this name, with the .SF and .DSA extensions, respectively.
# In this example, the files will be DUKESIGN.SF and DUKESIGN.DSA.

signature.file=DUKESIGN


# (Optional) The name to give to the signed JAR file.

out.file=signedJar.jar

</pre>

<p>Once the JAR file and the directive file have been created, the 
javakey command to sign a JAR file can be used. It is: 

<pre>
    javakey -gs <var>directivefile jarfile</var>
</pre>

where <i>directivefile</i> is the name (and path) of the directive file, 
and <i>jarfile </I> is the name (and path) of the JAR file. 

<p>The output of this command is a signed JAR file whose name will be 
the name specified by the value of the <code>out.file</code> property, if any,
specified in the directive file. If there is no <code>out.file</code> property, the signed JAR 
file name will be the same as that of the initial JAR file, but with the suffix <code>.sig</code>.

<p>The generated .SF and .DSA files will be added to the signed JAR file, in a
<code>META-INF</code> directory. If the base name for these files is 
<code>DUKESIGN</code>, as in the example above, the files added will be: <ul>

<li>META-INF/DUKESIGN.SF
<li>META-INF/DUKESIGN.DSA

</ul>

<p>Any files with these names in the signed JAR file will be overwritten.

<p>

Note: options may be specified with or without a preceding minus sign (-). 
Only <i>one</i> option may be specified per <b>javakey</b> command.

<dl>

<dt><b><code>-c </code></b><var>identity</var> <code>{true|false}</code>
<dd>
Creates a new identity with database username <i>identity</i>. The optional 
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code> designation specifies whether or not 
the identity is to be considered trusted. (The default is <code>false</code>.)
For example, the following creates an identity named <i>jane</i>, and 
specifies that she is trusted:<P>

<pre>
    javakey -c jane true
</pre>

<dt><b><code>-cs </code></b><var>signer</var> <code>{true|false}</code>
<dd>
Creates a new signer with database username <i>signer</i>. The optional 
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code> designation specifies whether or not 
the signer is to be considered trusted. (The default is <code>false</code>.) 
<p>

<dt><b><code>-t </code></b><var>idOrSigner</var> <code>{true|false}</code>
<dd>
Sets (or resets) the trust level for the specified identity or signer.

<dd>
Provides detailed information about the specified identity or signer.
<p>


<dt><b><code>-r </code></b><var>idOrSigner</var>
<dd>
Removes the specified identity or signer from the database.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-ik </code></b><var>identity keysrcfile</var>
<dd>
Imports the public key in the file <i>keysrcfile</i>, associating it with 
the specified <i>identity</i>.  The key must be in X.509 format.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-ikp </code></b><var>signer pubfile privfile</var>
<dd>
Imports the key pair (the public key in the file <i>pubfile</i> and the 
private key in the file <i>privfile</i>), associating them with the 
specified <i>signer</i>. The keys must be in X.509 format.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-ic </code></b><var>idOrSigner certsrcfile</var>
<dd>
Imports the public key certificate in the file <i>certsrcfile</i>, 
associating it with the specified entity (identity or signer). If a public 
key has already been associated with the entity in the datase, 
<b>javakey</b> ensures that it is the same as the public key certified in 
<i>certsrcfile</i>, and will report an error if they're not the same. If 
the entity does not yet have a public key associated with it, <b>javakey</b> 
will create the association, using the public key in <i>certsrcfile</i>.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-ii </code></b><var>idOrSigner</var>
<dd>
Sets information for the specified identity or signer. After you type in an 
"import information" command such as

<pre>
    javakey -ii jane
</pre>

<p>you will be instructed to type as many lines of information you want to 
supply for <i>jane</i>, ending with a line containing a single period to 
signal the end of the information. 
<p>

<dt><b><code>-gk </code></b><var>signer algorithm  keysize {pubfile} 
{privfile}</var>
<dd>
Generates a key pair (a public key and associated private key) for the 
specified <i>signer</i> using the specified <i>algorithm</i>, generating 
keys of length <i>keysize</i> bits. If a file <i>pubfile</i>  is specified, 
the public key will be written to that file. If, in addition, a file 
<i>privfile</i> is specified, the private key will be written to that file. 
Do the latter with great care; private keys must remain private or your 
security system is compromised.

<p>The <i>keysize</i> limits for the algorithm, if any, are those described in
<a href="../../guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#AppB">Appendix B</a> of the 
<i>Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference</i>.

<p>Note: <b>javakey</b> can always generate DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
keys. It can generate keys for a different algorithm only if (1) the 
specified name is a <a href="../../guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#AppA">
standard key generation algorithm name</a> such as <code>RSA</code>, and 
(2) there is a statically installed <a 
href="../../guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#Provider">provider</a> 
supplying an implementation for the specified key generation algorithm.

<p>Please note that there is no way to supply algorithm-specific key

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<blockquote>

To create a trusted identity called <i>jane</i> and a trusted signer called 
<i>joe</i>, use the following commands:

<pre>
    javakey -c jane true
    javakey -cs joe true
</pre>

<p>Suppose <i>jane</i> sends her public key by email to <i>joe</i> and 
he stores the key in the file named <code>/tmp/jane_pubkey</code>. It must 
be encoded in X.509/DER format. To import and associate that key with 
<i>jane</i>'s identity in the persistent database managed by <b>javakey</b>,
<i>joe</i> (or a system administrator) enters the following command:

<pre>
    javakey -ik jane /tmp/jane_pubkey
</pre>

<p>Let's also assume <i>joe</i> has a public and private key pair that he used 
in another context. He now wants to associate that key pair with his own 
username identifier in the database.  He does this with the following command, 
assuming that the public key is stored in <code>/tmp/joe_pubkey</code> and the 
private key in <code>/tmp/joe_privkey</code>:

<pre>
    javakey -ikp joe /tmp/joe_pubkey /tmp/joe_privkey
</pre>

<p>The keys must both be in X.509 format. They must be for the same 
algorithm, of course.

<p>To generate a new key pair for <i>joe</i> instead of using an existing 
key pair, the following command could be used:

<pre>
    javakey -gk joe DSA 512 /tmp/joe_pubkey
</pre>

<p>This command creates a DSA key pair, with 512-bit keys, and associates it 
with <i>joe</i>. The <b><code>-gk</code></b> command also optionally saves a 
copy of the public key in a file. The example uses the file 
<code>/tmp/joe_pubkey</code>. One reason <i>joe</i> might want to save 
the public key in a file is so that he can mail a copy of it to <i>jane</i>
or anyone else who needs it (e.g., to verify <i>joe</i>'s digital signatures 
of files). This command also optionally lets <i>joe</i> specify a file to
which to save the private key, if needed. However, saving the private key to 
a file should be done with great care.

<p>Before <i>joe</i> can sign any files, he must have one or more certificates 
associated with him, authenticating his public key. In order to generate a 
certificate for him, a directive file must first be created, specifying 
various information about <i>joe</i> and about the certificate issuer, the 
certificate's validity dates, etc. Suppose such a file has been generated (see
<a href = "#Certificates">Certificates</a>), and its name is <code>joeCertDirectiveFile</code>, in the <code>/tmp/</code> directory. A 
certificate for <i>joe</i> can then be generated by the command

<pre>
    javakey -gc /tmp/joeCertDirectiveFile
</pre>

As described in <a href = "#JARSigning">JAR Files and Digital Signatures</a>, 
signing a JAR file also requires the use of a directive file providing 
information required for the signature, such as the signer name and the 
number of the certificate to use for that signer. The command to sign the
JAR file named <code>jarfileA.jar</code>, using the directive file 
<code>joeJarDirectiveFile</code> is:

<pre>
    javakey -gs joeJarDirectiveFile jarfileA.jar
</pre>
