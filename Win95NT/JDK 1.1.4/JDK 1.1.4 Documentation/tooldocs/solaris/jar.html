<H1>jar-The Java Archive Tool</H1>
<blockquote>
Combines multiple files into a single JAR archive file.

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<blockquote>

The <b>jar</b> tool is a java application that combines multiple files
into a single JAR archive file. <b>jar</b> is a general-purpose
archiving and compression tool, based on ZIP and the <A
HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/">ZLIB</A> compression format.

However, <b>jar</b> was designed mainly to facilitate the packaging of
java applets or applications into a single archive.  When the
components of an applet or application (.class files, images and
sounds) are combined into a single archive, they may be downloaded by
a java agent (like a browser) in a single HTTP transaction, rather
than requiring a new connection for each piece.  This dramatically
improves download times. <!-- REMIND: put a link to download benchmark
statistics in here --> <b>jar</b> also compresses files and so further
improves download time. In addition, it allows individual entries in a
file to be signed by the applet author so that their origin can be
authenticated. The syntax for the jar tool is almost identical to the
syntax for the <code>tar</code> command.

<p>

The 3 types of input files for the jar tool are

<ul> 
<li> manifest file (optional)
<li> destination jar file 
<li> files to be archived 
</ul>

<p>

Typical usage is

<pre>
	% jar cf myjarfile *.class 
</pre>

In this example, all the class files in the current directory are
placed into the file named "myjarfile".  A manifest file is
automatically generated by the jar tool and is always the first entry
in the jar file.  By default, it is named META-INF/MANIFEST.INF.  The
manifest file is the place where any meta-information about the
archive is stored.  Refer to the <a
href="../../guide/jar/manifest.html">manifest specification</a> for
details about how meta-information is stored in the manifest file.

<p>

If you have a pre-existing manifest file that you want the jar tool to
use for the new jar archive, you can specify it using the -m option:

<pre>
	% jar cmf myManifestFile myJarFile *.class
</pre>

<p>

When files are added to a jar archive, the file and its MD5 and SHA
hashes are stored.  The hashes are entered into the manifest file.  It
is easy to view and process the contents of the manifest file, since
it uses RFC822 ascii format.

<a name=Options>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><b><code>c </b></code>
<dd>
Creates a new or empty archive on the standard output.
<p>

<dt><b><code>t </b></code>
<dd>
Lists the table of contents from standard output.
<p>

<dt><b><code>x </b></code><var>file</var>
<dd>
Extracts all files, or just the named files, from standard input. If <var>file</var> 
is omitted, then all files are extracted; otherwise, only the specified file or files 
are extracted.
<p>

<dt><b><code>f </b></code>
<dd>
The second argument specifies a jar file to process.  In the case of <b><code>c</code></b>reation,
this refers to the name of the jar file to be created (instead of on stdout).  For 
<b><code>t</code></b>able or <b><code>x</code></b>tract, the second argument identifies
the jar file to be listed or extracted.
<p>

<dt><b><code>v </b></code>
<dd>
Generates verbose output on stderr.
<p>

</dl>
</blockquote>

If any of <code>"files"</code> is a directory, then that directory is processed recursively.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<blockquote>
<P><P>
To add all the files in a particular directory to an archive:
<PRE>
$ ls
0.au            3.au            6.au            9.au            at_work.gif
1.au            4.au            7.au            Animator.class  monkey.jpg
2.au            5.au            8.au            Wave.class      spacemusic.au
$ jar cvf bundle.jar *
adding: 0.au
adding: 1.au
adding: 2.au
adding: 3.au
adding: 4.au
adding: 5.au
adding: 6.au
adding: 7.au
adding: 8.au
adding: 9.au
adding: Animator.class
adding: Wave.class
adding: at_work.gif
adding: monkey.jpg
adding: spacemusic.au
$
</PRE></PRE>
If already have subdirectories for images, audio files and classes in my
 html directory, I might jar up each directory into a single jar file:
<PRE>
$ ls
audio classes images
$ jar cvf bundle.jar audio classes images
adding: audio/1.au
adding: audio/2.au
adding: audio/3.au
adding: audio/spacemusic.au
adding: classes/Animator.class
adding: classes/Wave.class
adding: images/monkey.jpg
adding: images/at_work.gif
$ ls -l
total 142
drwxr-xr-x   2 brown    green        512 Aug  1 22:33 audio
-rw-r--r--   1 brown    green      68677 Aug  1 22:36 bundle.jar
drwxr-xr-x   2 brown    green        512 Aug  1 22:26 classes
drwxr-xr-x   2 brown    green        512 Aug  1 22:25 images
$ 
</PRE>
I can then see the entry names in the jarfile using the jar tool and the 
"t" option:
<PRE>
$ ls
audio bundle.jar classes images
$ jar tf bundle.jar
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
audio/1.au
audio/2.au
audio/3.au
audio/spacemusic.au
classes/Animator.class
classes/Wave.class
images/monkey.jpg
images/at_work.gif
$ 
</PRE>
Enumerating verbosely (with the "v" option) will tell me more information 
about the files in the archive, such as their size and last modified date:

<PRE>
$ jar tvf bundle.jar
   145 Thu Aug 01 22:27:00 PDT 1996 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
   946 Thu Aug 01 22:24:22 PDT 1996 audio/1.au
  1039 Thu Aug 01 22:24:22 PDT 1996 audio/2.au
   993 Thu Aug 01 22:24:22 PDT 1996 audio/3.au
 48072 Thu Aug 01 22:24:23 PDT 1996 audio/spacemusic.au
 16711 Thu Aug 01 22:25:50 PDT 1996 classes/Animator.class
  3368 Thu Aug 01 22:26:02 PDT 1996 classes/Wave.class
 12809 Thu Aug 01 22:24:48 PDT 1996 images/monkey.jpg
   527 Thu Aug 01 22:25:20 PDT 1996 images/at_work.gif
