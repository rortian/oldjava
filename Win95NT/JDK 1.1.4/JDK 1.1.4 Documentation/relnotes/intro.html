<h3>About This Release</h3>
<i><font size=-1>(This section is taken from the Introduction of the README file.)</font></i>
<p>

Thank you for downloading the JDK 1.1.4  release.
<p>

This is version 1.1.4  of the Java Development Kit, also known as 
JDK 1.1.4 .  The JDK lets you write applets and applications that 
conform to the Java 1.1 Core API.  It includes improvements in 
functionality, performance, and quality over JDK 1.0.2, and includes 
bug fixes since JDK 1.1.
<p>

JDK 1.1.4  is a bug-fix release.  Changes made to the JDK since 
the first 1.1 beta release are in the file named CHANGES.
<p>

Because there are no API changes in bug-fix releases, we continue 
to refer to this platform as the Java 1.1 Platform (rather than 1.1.4 ).   
While bugs have been fixed in 1.1.4 , the platform hasn't changed.
<p>

JDK 1.1 offers new capabilities:  Internationalization, signed applets, 
JAR file format, AWT (window toolkit) enhancements, JavaBeans(tm) 
component model, networking enhancements, Math package for large 
numbers, Remote Method Invocation, Reflection, database connectivity, 
new Java Native Interface, Object Serialization, Inner 
Classes, and performance enhancements.
<p>

For further description of these features, see the "New Feature 
Summary" in the JDK documentation.
<p>

As part of our ongoing effort to improve the quality of the JDK,
we will continue to fix bugs and develop new features.
In order to help us prioritize our bug-fixing effort, please submit
any bugs you find as soon as possible, using the procedure described 
in the "Reporting Bugs" section below.
<p>

We also publish a web page of technology related to the JDK, which
includes information about Java IDL, native threads, and
OS platforms.  Please refer to:
<pre>
   http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/jdkrelatedtech.html
</pre>
The JDK is a product of Sun Microsystems, Inc.  
JavaSoft is the operating company of Sun that develops the JDK.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The JDK allows you to:
<ul>
      <li>Develop applets that will run in browsers supporting Java 1.1,
          such as HotJava version 1.0, and future versions of Netscape 
 	  Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

      <li>Develop Java applications.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Version Compatibility</h2>

In general, any applet or application that ran in JDK 1.0.2 should
run correctly in JDK 1.1.  A failure to do so is a bug, except 
for a small number of cases where compatibility has had to be
broken to close potential security holes, or fix implementation 
or design bugs.  
<p>
Of course, applets that depend on any new 1.1 APIs will not work on 
any browsers that support only 1.0.2, such as Internet Explorer 3.0, 
Netscape 3.0, and the alpha and pre-beta1 versions of the HotJava 
browser.  However, in general, applets relying only on APIs defined 
in 1.0.2 (but compiled with the JDK 1.1 compiler) will run on 1.0.2 
browsers.  This "downwards" compatibility has not been extensively 
tesed and cannot be guaranteed. 
<p>
For more details, see the document on compatibility at:
<pre>
   http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/compatibility.html
</pre>
If you find any such incompatibilities that are not listed on the
Compatibility web page, please report them to us as noted below
under "Reporting Bugs," and mention that they are compatibility
bugs.  Compatibility is critically important to us, and a cornerstone
of Java's "Write Once Run Anywhere" promise.

<h3>What This Documentation Covers</h3>

<blockquote>
NOTE - The documentation included in this download bundle covers only the new 
features of version 1.1.  It does not attempt to cover the features that have 
remained unchanged since 1.0.  For information about those features, see the 
documentation available on the JavaSoft website in 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html">The Java Tutorial</a> 
and in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/index.html">Java Series of books</a>.
</blockquote>

The <a href="../">Contents page</a> of this documentation contains links to 
all of the documentation in this release, plus links to some pages on the JavaSoft 
website.  Note the first few entries are actually located in the <code>java</code> 
(software) directory rather than in the <code>docs</code> (documentation) directory.  
If you download just the documentation and not the software, you will not be 
able to access those <code>java</code> files.

<p>Most of this documentation package is in HTML.  Portable Document Format (PDF) 
and Postscript (PS) versions of sections of this document are also available 
from the download page 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1</a>.

<p>For the most part, this JDK documentation is standalone.
This means once you've downloaded the JDK docs, you can disconnect from 
the web, and browse the JDK docs locally.  Some ancillary documentation,
such as the Java Tutorial, is available by links to the JavaSoft website.
