Welcome to the Java Series

</h1>
<a><a name="26633">
Java is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language. Its syntax is similar 
to C and C++ but omits semantic features that make C and C++ complex, confusing, and 
insecure. Java was initially developed to address the problems of building software for 
small distributed systems to embed in consumer devices. As such it was designed for 
heterogeneous networks, multiple host architectures, and secure delivery. To meet these 
requirements, compiled Java code had to survive transport across networks, operate on any 
client, and assure the client that it was safe to run.

The popularization of the World Wide Web helped catapult these attributes of Java 
into the limelight. The Internet demonstrated how interesting, media-rich content could be 
made accessible in simple ways. Web browsers like Mosaic enabled millions of people to 
roam the Net and made Web surfing part of popular culture. At last there was a medium 
where what you saw and heard was essentially the same whether you were on a Mac, PC 
or UNIX machine, connected to a high-speed network or a modem.
<p>
</a><a name="25928">
But with popularity comes scrutiny and soon Web enthusiasts felt that the content 
supported by the Web&#146;s HTML document format was too limited. HTML extensions like 
forms only highlighted those limitations while making it clear that no browser could 
include all the features users wanted. Extensibility was the answer. At just this time the 
Java programming language found itself looking for another application. 
<p>
</a><a name="26348">
Sun&#146;s HotJava browser was developed to showcase Java&#146;s interesting properties by 
making it possible to embed Java programs inside Web pages. These Java programs, 
known as <em>applets</em>, are transparently downloaded into the HotJava browser along with the 
HTML pages in which they appear. Before being accepted by the browser, applets are 
carefully checked to make sure they are safe. Like HTML pages, compiled Java programs 
are network- and platform-independent. Applets behave the same regardless of where they 
come from or what kind of machine they are being loaded into. 
<p>
</a><a name="26315">
The Web community quickly noticed that Java was something new and important. 
With Java as the extension language, a Web browser could have limitless capabilities. 
Programmers could write an applet once and it would then run on any machine, anywhere. 
Visitors to Java-powered Web pages could use the content found there with confidence 
that nothing would damage their machine.
<p>
</a><a name="25931">
With applets as the initial focus, Java has demonstrated a new way to make use of the 
Internet to distribute software. This new paradigm goes beyond browsers. We believe it is 
an innovation with the potential to change the course of computing.

Java software distribution supports this new paradigm. The software is stored on the 
Web and can be downloaded with a click of the mouse. Java documentation is made 
available in the same way. It can be dowloaded from our FTP site or read on-line as 
HTML. With our API documentation we pioneered a method of creating large hypertext 
based reference documentation for distribution on the Web. But we recognize that the 
enormous world-wide interest in learning more about Java calls for the availability of Java 
books as well. Hence the Java Series.

The books in this series provide definitive reference documentation for Java 
programmers and end users. They are written by members of the Java team and published 
under the auspices of Sun Microsystems. The authors&#146; standards for quality, accuracy, and 
completeness have created books that are meant to support our users for years to come.

Our partnership with the Corporate and Professional Publishing Group at Addison-
Wesley has been a big factor in the success of the Series. Our editor Mike Hendrickson 
and his team have done a superb job of navigating us through the world of publishing. 
Within Sun, the support of James Gosling, Ruth Hennigar, and Bill Joy of Sun 
Microsystems ensured that this series would have the resources it needed to be successful. 
A personal note of thanks to my children Christopher and James for putting a positive spin 
on the many trips to my office during the development of the Series.
