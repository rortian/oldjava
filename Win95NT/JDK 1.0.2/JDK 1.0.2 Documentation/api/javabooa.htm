Java Packages
</h2>

<p>Java interfaces and classes are grouped into <em>packages</em>.  The following are the java packages, from which you can access interfaces and classes, and then fields, constructors, and methods.
<p> 

<dl>
<dt><a href="java.htm">java.lang</a></dt>
<dd>Package that contains essential Java classes, including numerics, strings, objects, compiler, runtime, security, and threads.  This is the only package that is automatically imported into every Java program.

<dt><a href="javac.htm">java.io</a>
<dd>Package that provides classes to manage input and output streams to read data from and write data to files, strings, and other sources. 

<dt><a href="javae.htm">java.util</a>
<dd>Package that contains miscellaneous utility classes, including generic data structures, bit sets, time, date, string manipulation, random number generation, system properties, notification, and enumeration of data structures.

<dt><a href="javaf.htm">java.net</a>
<dd>Package that provides classes for network support, including URLs, TCP sockets, UDP sockets, IP addresses, and a binary-to-text converter.

<dt><a href="javag.htm">java.awt</a>
<dd>Package that provides an integrated set of classes to manage user interface components such as windows, dialog boxes, buttons, checkboxes, lists, menus, scrollbars, and text fields. (AWT = Abstract Window Toolkit) 

<dt><a href="javak.htm">java.awt.image</a>
<dd>Package that provides classes for managing image data, including color models, cropping, color filtering, setting pixel values, and grabbing snapshots. 

<dt><a href="javal.htm">java.awt.peer</a>
<dd>Package that connects AWT components to their platform-specific implementations (such as Motif widgets or Microsoft Windows controls).

<dt><a href="javam.htm">java.applet</a>
<dd>Package that enables the creation of applets through the Applet class.  It also provides several interfaces that connect an applet to its document and to resources for playing audio. 

</dl>

Sun Packages
</h2>

<dl>
<dt><a href="Package-sun.tools.debug.html">sun.tools.debug</a></dt>
<dd>Package that contains the debug interfaces and classes.

<center><h4><a name="Interim">NOTE: This is an Interim Document</a></h4></center>
<blockquote>
<p>This document is an interim HTML version of the API documentation. This version has been revised and updated by the JavaSoft engineers and thus represents the most current documentation for Java 1.0.2. 
<p>We are aware that this version is currently missing two important features from the previous version:  the Class Hierarchy page (which lists all of the classes) and the class hierarchy at the top of each class page. We will add these back in the final version of the documentation. 

<p>This version was not generated using the javadoc program.  It was instead generated from the FrameMaker files that will soon be published as the book "Java Application Programming Interface" by Addison-Wesley.</blockquote>
